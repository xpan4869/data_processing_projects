2024-11-25,That makes sense  It just sucks because my doctors right now  who I finally found will listen to my concerns  do not accept Kaiser and I don t love the idea of re starting and being forced to go through Kaiser    I emailed to see if I can get on the Regence still and maybe they just are not upfront about it being an option  Just seems fishy that they are allowed to do that as a company,-1.0

2024-12-10,Carriers estimate claims for the next year and add a charge to cover their fixed costs  This is true regardless of what type of insurance ie medical  dental  DI whatever  It doesn t matter the general process is the same   Employers do not price insurance  They choose from plans made available by whatever carriers the agent quoted   You re pretty insulting for someone who lacks detailed information especially about a subject as specific as insurance   The employer pays some or all of the premium and the employee pays the rest  The minimum employer contribution is normally     but they have no influence over what the actual rate is,0.0

2024-12-01,No this is wrong  You shouldn t be calling the doctors office to confirm next work status  You confirm it with your insurance  When you call the doctors office  the person answering the phone doesn t know anything about network status  they generally only know what insurance companies they bill  Billing an insurance company doesn t mean the provider is networking with a specific plan,0.0

2024-11-25,Yep  if they handle it at all differently that d be a mental health parity violation for sure  If you have your provider request it  have them mention your mobility issues and that they re uniquely qualified to treat you because they are also disabled  if they re comfortable disclosing that of course   I d also suggest they mention that their credentialing is in process  and that alone may be enough for them to go ahead and do it,0.0

2024-12-12,I think it depends on your insurance company  your plan  and your location  My experience has mostly been with smaller regional not for profit health plans and some of the stories I hear about carriers like Cigna and United blow my mind  My state is also pretty consumer friendly with regards to health insurance so my experience could be different than someone else  One important thing to note is that mistakes happen  I have seen a lot of claims pay incorrectly  for example the claim may be related to an ER visit but will process out of network in error   If you get a denial that you think is questionable  call the health plan  In many cases it is an error that can be resolved easily  If you don t get an adequate response then you have the option to appeal or file a complaint with your state regulators  For services that should be covered under the federal  no surprises act you have the option of filing a complaint as well  Always read your plan documents and contact your insurance company prior to receiving services to determine coverage  If they have an email option that is great because then you will have the response in writing  I have seen many scenarios where insurance companies had to overturn a denial because they had given incorrect information prior to the service   The other important thing is that you make an informed decision when you select your plan  Not everyone has options but in some cases  especially with large employers  people will have a couple of different plans to choose from  If you are covered through your spouse  ask them to involve you in their decision  I cannot tell you how many times I have encountered patients who select the cheapest plan without understanding that it is cheap for a reason and then are shocked when they need medical care and realize that their preferred hospitals are not covered under the cheaper plan  Or are shocked because their deductible or copay is so high    With insurance it s crucial that you do your research and understand your coverage before seeking care  Check your benefits  any limitations  make sure that your doctor is in network  If your PCP refers you to a specialist it is not a given that the specialist participates in your plan  If have a consultation with an in network surgeon for a surgery that will be done in a hospital  make sure that the hospital is in network too  There is a lot of good information on cms gov about patient protections under the no surprises act  and they have a hotline and complaint process,-1.0
2024-12-02,im in virginia  i think this might be one of those states as she is listed as the provider for some of the appointments  unless that isn t her either lol    as for the debt itself  i actually shouldn t owe it all  it was supposed to be covered by medicaid but they nor i was ever made aware of the balance,-1.0
2024-11-28,Yeah  Stride asked me for my total income  per my last tax return    k but it fluctuates  of course   I ve checked marketplace but once I put in all my info and check mark the box that says my employer offers  affordable insurance  basically it says I m not eligible for savings and all the plans are       month for just myself,-1.0

2024-11-27,You would have to ask for a network gap exception from Anthem  If there truly is no other doctor in network that can handle this care  they will try to find someone out of network that will agree to a single case agreement  sign a contract for this care for a certain amount of time   The doctor would have to agree to the in network pricing though  it s not as if Anthem will just eat the costs of the out of network care,-1.0
2024-11-26,Can you expand on what you mean by non ACA  You re almost guaranteed to be denied coverage for anything pre existing on a non ACA plan  That and there are often waiting periods for surgical procedures on medically underwritten plans    That aside  you can purchase an individual policy through healthcare gov being offered insurance through work almost always means you ll be ineligible for subsidies which means you ll have to pay full price for the premiums    Your primary isn t Kaiser  is it  Asking because they re incredibly difficult to work with in terms of coordination of benefits    It may be easiest and most cost effective to consider surgery from an in network provider under your      employer plan,-1.0
2024-12-09,I do owe money  but I make monthly payments to them because I had to get testing through them  I just paid them on the   th        When they called to confirm my appointment  they said they needed to collect my      payment and my copay at the time of services  I told them I just paid you guys      like a week ago  and I met my OOP Max   Deductible  They were rude and said well no matter what  we will be taking your copay tomorrow  I may need to just find a new immunologist and drive an hour away because this Dr always takes over an hour sitting in the back waiting for the Dr  They don t communicate between office staff  etc,-1.0

2024-12-04,You would be paying full price for marketplace insurance if you did that    it would be very very expensive    You re eligible for Medicaid because you have no income  that means you re not eligible for premium tax credits anymore     You can t pick and choose what program you re eligible for   it depends on your income      Although  you should be reporting      income not      income    Are you going to be working in,0.0
2024-12-17,The clinic I go to the doctor doesn t even do most of that if any of that  I know because he tells me I m going to have this person call you to help you  And I m sorry but I don t think doctors have some hold on the world of what s soul crushing and complicated and hard inexpensive  But I have noticed a lot of doctors have a complex that the world is all about them,-99.0
2024-12-13,They worked with the insurance beforehand and got approval  and I was told the medical treatment would be paid for  That s what they were told,-1.0
2024-12-10,Something doesn t really make sense in terms of your coverage being cancelled  This is completely normal if your family size or another change makes you eligible for Medicaid   you cannot receive ACA subsidies if you could otherwise be covered by Medicaid  so the change is made automatically Â   Same thing happened to me when we added my son to the marketplace plan my husband and daughter are on   turns out in my state  as a family of   our kids qualify for Medicaid  so they were both automatically removed from the private policy backdated to the date of my son s birth  We had zero say in it  I actually didn t know what had happened until it was already done,-1.0
2024-12-04,Kaiser is very different than other health plans  you have to do everything within Kaiser and it functions more like a strict HMO where you can t go elsewhere    You probably owe because you haven t met your deductible yet and the plan didn t cover      of the bill  If they didn t cover any of it  you may not have coverage for urgent care visits or that clinic was out of network  It s impossible to know without more details of your exact plan,-1.0
2024-12-15,I can t comment on whether OP is being paranoid   All I can say is that employers do all kinds of things which are against the law and blatantly discriminatory   Suing for wrongful termination is not a walk in the park and not necessarily a slam dunk  I would advise OP to proactively consult a very experienced employment lawyer and so you can take measures that would strengthen your case in the event they do terminate you    Also   given that you are contemplating quitting and getting Medicaid disability there seems to be no reason not to go on your employer s policy since the worst that can happen is something that you seem to be prepared to accept  And if it happens you can sue   Also if you are terminated you would be able to collect unemployment    As practical advice I would advise you to cut your budget as much as possible so that you have as much money saved as possible,-1.0
2024-12-11,It was not written for Vyvance  no DAW on the script    I m starting to think I shouldn t fill at the small local pharmacy come January  And should instead try walgreens    I still need to call my insurance company and ask how much more it will cost since their letter was so vague,-1.0

2024-12-09,You ll probably want to start with a plan  However  if it s benign  you may have an uphill battle to get insurance to approve its removal  You ll need to show that it is irritating  itching  gets caught on clothes  etc   or limits your daily activities   not just that it s unsightly  Just being unsightly will be a cosmetic procedure that no insurance is going to cover,-1.0

2024-12-06,Insurance has nothing to do with rich and powerful people skipping the line for stuff like this  It happens much more on an individual basis  I ve worked in some world class centers and taken care of some very rich patients  An insurer calling us wouldn t do shit for them  Our CEO s assistant calling us is a different story,0.0

2024-12-01,This is a little different than OPs situation  With OPs post  they did give the correct insurance  medicaid  and the provider failed to bill medicaid  So  OP owes nothing  Providers who are in network with medicaid are not allowed to bill a patient  medicaid picks it up    In your situation  the correct primary insurance was not given to the provider  so the provider did nothing wrong as they were not aware of the new insurance  By the time the other insurance figured it out  it was probably too late  you were passed the time the rightful insurance would accept a claim  Most insurance has a        day window to submit a claim on time  After that  the claims are automatically denied for being a late submission    and there is no way around that  So while I m very sorry your claim played out with you having to pay  that s the  correct  outcome when you fail to provide the correct insurance  I ve seen this happen even   years later  unfortunately  Insurance seems to always figure out when they incorrectly paid  and there is another insurance who should have paid    Couple of tips to avoid this     Child should have given the correct insurance      Should have checked the rightful insurance to make sure a claim was filed with them  If you don t see a claim at least pending after     weeks in the rightful primary insurance portal  that d be a good sign something may be amiss  Call the provider and make sure they have the right insurance  At     weeks after an appointment  they can still fix an insurance billing issue as they are still within the timely claims filing window,0.0
2024-12-04,They can under two circumstances      They pay out of pocket  or     Their insurance company agrees they need it  Insurance is not designed to cover what you want  it s designed to cover what you need   I have never been denied for a medical intervention  and I m chronically ill  both physically and mentally  However  having worked in insurance  I ve seen plenty of people get denied    Sometimes  it s a case of the doctor or hospital wanting to bill for a higher cost procedure when a cheaper one is just as effective or even more effective   they just want more money  In that way  it protects patients   Other times  doctors don t provide enough information for the insurance company to make an educated decision on your care  The number of people who have had physical therapy who then got denied for scans due to lack of PT is too high,-1.0

2024-12-08,Hi friend  Looks like they re trying to put you on a non ACA compliant Indemnity Plan  These plans pay set amounts for visits or procedures  Often they ve got reputations for being very difficult to pay out  Additionally  if once they do pay  it s only the amount specified in the plan and you re on the hook for the remaining amount    The fact that they re also pushing you to marketplace plans via a broker tells me they know the indemnity plan is       If you re currently on a traditional plan  that loss of coverage could be considered a QLE  Double check with your wife s plan if you can be added if you decline the non ACA compliant plan    I would take a look at healthcare gov and see what you actually qualify for as an individual and compare it to what the broker is offering you,0.0

2024-12-10,The hospital where I had my cancer treatment just started this as well   My understanding is that Medicare  Medicaid  vet and government healthcare insurances cover the Provider Based Billing fee   Many private insurances do not   Most hospitals own or are buying the providers  buildings   It was said to me   The people in the offices need to get paid  too   Your insurance only pays the doctor fee    Not sure that it was said correctly  but it was said   And  my first PBB fee was at my gastro visit for        Hospitals used to try and collect balance based billing  now illegal in Michigan   But  renaming it Provider Based Billing means you must pay  until someone does something to stop it   But  as government run insurances cover it  or maybe just exempt by contract  hmmmm    there is no government incentive to outlaw the practice   They even charge it for virtual visits  i e  my nutritionist   I m actually going to test Teladoc for my next nutritionist appointment for just a     copay   You might try that for some of your less important visits if your insurance provides it  as Teladoc does not yet charge PBB   Good luck,0.0
2024-11-29,I do not think your reply is correct but I am not an expert    Before the ACA  if you went in for a free preventive care colonoscopy screening and the doctor found a polyp and removed it  the insurance company would deny it was a free screening and claim it was an expensive medical procedure   The ACA prevented the insurance companies from doing this,0.0
2024-11-21,The other thing to keep in mind is that without a health insurance policy providers bill sticker price for their services  In a PPO contract  which is what most of them are  you will benefit from a negotiated discount between the insurance company and the provider even if you have to pay the entire cost  For many items these negotiated discounts can be substantial with the biggest discounts I ve seen being on lab services which commonly bill    times the negotiated cost for people who don t have insurance,0.0

2024-11-29,Depending on the polyps  the usual repeat window for something like this is     years  Getting it done at      years would technically be not medically indicated and grounds for them to decline the ENTIRE procedure  Most insurances have either a    day or one calendar month grace period  but insurance is also playing the same end of year reset game in reverse  There is no benefit for them to be flexible  and the rules are on their side here  The providers office has probably been through this before and has policies in place to avoid getting shafted by insurance and then having to harass their patients for the whole bill   The only thing that might work is if you had new symptoms or a change in symptoms that would justify a colonoscopy regardless of polyps  Things like blood in stool  unexplained weight loss  unexplained anemia or iron deficiency would be grounds for a colonoscopy even if you had a normal one a year ago  At this point in the year though there probably not any more routine colonoscopy slots  Cancellation spots get filled fast at the end of the year   Basically  you are probably stuck with the bill next year  The recheck window is broad  so if you can t afford it in early       you could ask your provider if you can safely put it off until you can  They may even say      is okay if the polyps were low risk and you want to switch to a lower deductible plan the year you need it done,-1.0

2024-12-02,Yes  it completely sucks that you owe a higher amount since the claim went thru your insurance  Not to make excuses  but self pay is cheaper most of the time due to no administrative work having to be done in regards to generating a bill  submitting bill to insurance  waiting on payment  and sometimes  having to fight insurance for payment   See if the hospital will take the payment amount of the self pay amount as payment in full  Probably won t happen  but never hurts to ask  You can also see if they will give you a discount anyway if you offer to pay your responsibility in full at one time,-1.0

2024-12-13,I m sorry to hear about your claim denial  it sounds like a tough situation  Based on what you shared  it seems UnitedHealthcare may not have received enough documentation to support the procedure  Unfortunately  all insurance companies have similar requirements  and doctors face serious penalties if they don t follow underwriting standards  which might explain why it was hard to find someone to help  Many other doctors might not see it the way you do  I d recommend asking your doctor to review the denial and then request a peer to peer review with the insurer  It can sometimes turn things around  Keep in mind  it is on the doctor s office of the insured to provide information that aligns with your policy benefits and claims procedures  We go through a lot of training to submit claims  and some of us are not very likely to get denied while a lot of others will  I hope this gets resolved for you soon,0.0

2024-12-07,I was at a big tertiary center to be evaluated for autologous stem cell transplant  and it was a full day of testing in different buildings on campus  The receptionist at the lab didn t want to check me in for my blood draw because she literally did not understand what an OOPM was  I tried to explain it to her  patiently but we were just caught in a loop  I picked up my phone to call my transplant coordinator and she caved immediately  to my surprise    She was holding something up that was much bigger than her lol   Don t ever pay something you don t owe,-1.0
2024-11-26,Healthcare gov generally provides no reasonable option for those of us who split their time between different states or regions  is impossible to even apply for correctly for those of us with unpredictable and or seasonally varied incomes  and may have no option for many specialty needs    Did it improve a lot of things for a lot of people  Yes    Are there some of us left out of that  who need a different option  Also yes,-1.0
2024-12-06,I worked in a neurology office  We would often suggest to patients to go the  self pay  route because it was OFTEN LESS EXPENSIVE than with their insurance  It s pointless to have health insurance  It covers barely anything  expensive  and then they will deny deny claims,-1.0
2024-12-11,I had to wait about a year from when symptoms first started to get my gall bladder removed because I had to wait a few months to see a doctor  then wait months of basically  diet and see if you approve because it s probably  IBS   before insurance would finally approve the scan required to get it removed  when I happened to have a bout of pancreatitis from it which required much more help   Doctor wanted to do the scan to start but insurance wouldn t approve it so I had to wait months and suffer to basically get help  While paying thousands out of pocket in premiums    A colleague of mine paid thousands in premiums but due to insurance issues  had to wait almost three months to get their cancer treatment started due to approval issues and wait times    A friend of mine waited about a year to get a necessary back surgery done due to insurance fuckery which prevented the doctor from getting him scheduled quickly  And then once the doctor got the ok from insurance  my friend had to wait about three months for the surgery despite being in severe pain and basically unemployed due to it   He also paid thousands in premiums over that time    So we have all the issues with wait times plus greater costs,-1.0

2024-12-01,This is an interesting plan  to say the least  From what I read from what you posted  the amount that the in network provider would be contracted to receive is      of the MCFS based on your locality  I would imagine this is a select plan of sorts  It notes you don t have OON coverage with the exception of emergency services  but the part about it paying      of the MCFS is confusing since you don t have out of network coverage  I would be careful with a plan like this,-1.0
2024-12-09,Funny enough  there is language about appeals   I called  had someone keep me on the phone for over an hour while she looked for it  jibber jabbering the entire time so I couldn t do something else  before finally telling me she had to call someone to figure out whether they would  send me the form    I had to get on a conference call  so I gave up   I said  you have my account info  and my phone number  let me know    Of course  no response     Oh  and during the hour of her jibber jabbering  she asked me some personal medical information and then made judgements about my lifestyle   It was NOT a good experience     As for how can they attach a claim to it    I don t really know how their software programs work  but why wouldn t they have a way to keep track of every denied claim  whatever it s for   Wouldn t it be helpful to know that they deny claims for a name brand  but allow a generic   I suspect there s a way   A really easy way   But they don t want us to be able to see it,-1.0

2024-12-08,I m at a point that I would prefer this level of service over facing financial ruin for medical treatment  My family had an extremely expensive  unsubsidized  ACA plan one year  Premiums were over       month with high deductibles  Almost no providers accepted it  We ended up going to Medicaid providers since they were the only ones that accepted ACA plans and we received the same level of care as Medicaid patients  But here s the kicker   our daughter needed surgery but the best children s hospital told us they didn t accept any ACA plans  They did  however  accept Medicaid  My daughter s surgery went fine at our local general hospital  but she could ve had her surgery at the children s hospital if we had Medicaid,-1.0

2024-12-11,I know  it s just such a shock to get a bill equal to my mortgage  The reason I had decided to post here was mostly to force myself to take a few minutes and breath so I can be collected and handle the issue with grace  The insight is helpful too  to make sure there isn t something I was missing about the situation  I ve always been relatively healthy so it s the first time I ve dealt with a bill larger than a simple clinic visit,-1.0
2024-12-08,Everything about this scenario sucks   Your physician is not going to be paid  and is out of all the payment they  should  have received for their labor and expertise   You now get to be the patient who has the questionable victory of being able to slip out from their bill  Yay you   And  in the meantime  the insurance company gets to keep  all  of the premium dollars paid to it by you and your employer  and or by the federal government    This all  sucks     Unless we re all actually rooting for the insurance company  in which case  Yay Insurance  I guess,-1.0

2024-11-21,My worry  regarding not having insurance and  I guess  just not paying the bill  is that plenty of situations require ongoing care   So even if they would do the first step without an upfront payment  when you don t pay  thry will have to stop treating you    Cancer  for example usually has MRI   Then usually surgery   Then recover from surgery possibly with physical therapy   Then multiple radiation treatments across several weeks   Then multiple chemo treatments could go on for months   Maybe they will do the beginning  but not everything you need   Plus  I hear it more often now you have to pay something up front,-1.0
2024-12-03,No  They take zero responsibility for inaccurate listings  All of the health insurances do this  it s just that some are worse and less reliable than others   It s in the insurance companies  best interests to claim that a wide variety of doctors  offices accept their insurance  even if they really don t  so all those  doctor lookups  they put up on their sites are only suggestions  even though they re misleadingly marketed as reliable databases  This should be illegal and heavily fined  but until it is  they re going to keep screwing us all over,-1.0

2024-12-11,Even before this happened  trust has been eroded to a point where the insurance companies aren t going to easily salvage it  If they continue to deny claims  making consumers fight for their coverage to work for them  the insurance industry will continue to be hated by Americans  There are other scams in health insurance  such as out of network providers working for in network hospitals  that addressing could improve public perception  but they clearly won t do anything that cuts into their profit margin  If people actually receive care for the   high cost to have insurance and high deductible to use it  then maybe we could move forward without all this animosity,-1.0
2024-12-08,Sorry to hear about your issue  I was a supervisor for Ambetter call center for a few years Â  Being a ACA  OBAMACARE plan Â  you are eligible for premium reductions based on your income Â  This is great BUT  the way they do this is very very haphazard and leaves people with giant coverage gaps sometimes Â  Here is what I think happened in your case Â  You or your wife had a change of income Â  The the Marketplace aka the Exchange received an update showing that your income changed from     to      Â  When this happens they will cancel the plan you have and then enroll you in a new plan or sometime the same plan with a lower premium Â  They are SUPPOSED to make the new plan effective the next day after the old plan was cancelled Â  Sometimes they will screw up and give you a start date for the new plan at the first of the following month Â  And Â  Â It s not something that AMBETTER can fix because your enrollment is handled by the Marketplace Â Â  Â  I have a ton of experience dealing with this BS Â  Â  I can give you steps of what to do  Â  Â  But  I need to know a couple thingsÂ    Â  Â   Â  What state do you live in   Â  Â   Â  Were you and your wife on the same plan  Â  Â  Â   Â  Did they cancelÂ  her and then restart her plan with a coverage gap  Â  Or did the just cancel her completelyÂ  Â  Â   Â  Did they cancel her from Ambetter and thenÂ  Â  Â put her on yourÂ  states MEDICAID plan Â Â  Â  Â  Most of these exchanges will automatically put you on Medicaid   whether you want it or not  if your income drops below a certain amount OR if a woman has a baby,-1.0

2024-11-28,One thing I do wish the government would do is create a trust fund partially funded by the individual and partially backed by a tax on the insurance companies for those of us who have reached the hill such as myself      and want to buy long term care coverage   While we could very well afford it on our own now  those rates go up exponentially as you age which really renders it useless,-1.0

2024-12-14,That post is archived so I can t share my new recent experience switching  The company I work for  which employs somewhere in the area of           employees across all states  recently was informed our UHC plans would go up an unsustainable amount  Their reasoning is that since out business segment is in the powersports industry   we had too many related claims  This resulted in the switch to Surest  My per paycheck deduction is going from      to      for myself and my two kids  I pay about a     of the premium   A     increase in my per paycheck deduction year over year and that s without knowing what the increase from UHC would have been had we as a company stayed    This past year I underwent surgery for tennis elbow  had a few neurologist visits for my kids  those were scary at first   and some extra testing all under my current UHC plan    Surest really tries to sell you on the  You don t have a deductible  design of the plan  That seems nice until you look at the details  The Surest website allows you to search by provider and service to see what the costs for visits would amount to so I decided to do a comparison using this year s claims    My current plan has        copays for office visits      Urgent Care  and      ER  The new plan with Surest would be variable         copays for office visits      Urgent Care  and       ER  This is crazy  I then checked all the docs we ve visited this past year and the copays would range from         copays for office visits that we underwent  I then plugged that data into a spreadsheet to show the detailed breakdown and comparison  Essentially  if I were on Surest this year I d have paid an extra        Gotta love this country and our healthcare system    https   preview redd it  rs n bpnv e  png width     format png auto webp s       b      dd f ba be   f  ed ea   f b,-1.0

2024-12-12,After reading all of these comments  I just want to say that this is one of the most fucked up things about our healthcare system  and it annoys me to no end   I ve gone in for things that should ve been completely covered as preventative  but the doctor did ONE little extra thing that I didn t know would be extra  and of course I was billed for it    I m not sure how you are supposed to stop this from happening  Every time your doctor asks you a question  are you supposed to confirm with him that this is part of the preventative exam  If he pulls a piece of lint out of your ear  are you supposed to say   are you charging extra for that   Because they probably are   I get so incredibly angry when I get a bill for something extra that i don t know was extra   and yes  I did actually get a bill for them pulling a piece of lint out of my ear during an exam   It s absolutely ridiculous,-1.0

2024-12-16,Dental plans are more like discount plans  They are not like health insurance   I would estimate that at      year you are breaking even on the preventive services  Usually fillings are covered from day   as basic services  but crowns  root canals  etc  need six months of continuous coverage before treatment  This is so you don t join  pay one month  get a bunch of treatments and then abandon your plan   My dental insurance company  Delta Dental  said as long as I had continuous coverage with any dental insurance they waive the   months Â   But yes  you are right the cost sharing for dental plans is not great and annual maximums is also not great  Most people have to spread their treatment out over years when they need major work done  But it is cheaper generally than paying out of pocket   We have a lot of dentists in my area who offer their own discount plans for about the same price as the big dental companies  They are more like concierge services but from what I can tell  the cost is about the same  our pediatric dentist offered this and it was about what you listed   The challenge is if you are referred to a specialist  periodontist  or oral surgeon  the indecent dentist s concierge plans won t cover so you are SOL  Better to have done the dental insurance,-1.0

2024-12-08,In terms of moving forward  here are a ton of ideas    I would look at all the ambulance companies in your area and identify if any are in network  Then if your daughter does need a transfer  at least you know what can be done  And be really really honest with your care providers about the financial implications of an ambulance  just as you had been previously  doctors understand and can help you think of alternatives that would work  I wouldn t lie or refuse to give information  first of all  you ll want them to have her medical chart and history which is under her name available in order to properly treat her    Second  see if you can call a nurse triage emergency line at the ER before bringing her in to determine if she really needs to go in immediately or if you could drive her the    min to the pediatric ER  It sounds like you had done this previously and were advised to stay home and monitor  while that is stressful  if it s saving you a ton of money that can be put towards your kids future  it might be worth the trade off  See if there are medical devices you can buy to more critically monitor her at home  like a pulse ox or a blood pressure reader  That might make you more comfortable with a long drive or a  wait and see   You can always be on route to the children s hospital and then call an ambulance if she gets worse in the car    Another idea  you said she was a teen   is she an older teen  I don t know how specialized your pediatric floor is  but sometimes they can make exceptions and admit older teens to regular floors if their issue is not too complicated    Appeal with your insurance company until you re out of appeals  for each individual case  If one case is overturned  ie  they decide to pay   have them go back and look at your prior cases  Document every phone call with dates  names of reps  etc  Submit complaints to the insurance office in every way you can  Be so annoying    Once you ve exhausted that process  you can try the ambulance company  If both bills are from the same provider  you may be able to negotiate to pay     up front and have the rest forgiven  Google this before you do it  because you ll want the deal documented properly  Alternatively  made medical providers offer    interest payment plans  While you re still paying a lot  ultimately    interest is a huge win    Some of these suggestions may be helpful  some may not  Hopefully you get some medical answers regarding your daughter s condition which will help you avoid these emergency scenarios,-1.0

2024-12-14,Thank you  To clarify as far as normal copays  with the insurance I have through my employer I typically have a     copay on visits that are not preventative  for annual exams  screenings  teeth cleaning  etc  I can just walk out  Because I ve never had to pay that copay at my psychiatrist s office  I m worried they ve been billing Medi Cal when I don t qualify anymore  If it s just a matter of needing to pay those copays back from the last few years  I m all right with that  Really just don t want any additional trouble,-1.0
2024-12-03,The idea that insurance will promote less expensive healthcare is laughable   Oftentimes cash prices for things are cheaper than the  negotiated  insurance rate   When I had physical therapy  only a certain number of visits were covered and after that it was the contracted rate  which was higher than cash price  so the physical therapist office gave me the option to do either   Note that the cash price would not go towards deductible  so if there may be more expenses later that would put you to your deductible or max out of pocket  you may end up spending more in total paying the lower price now,-1.0

2024-12-14,Welcome to the nightmare of healthcare  What happened sounds pretty normal  The thing is that you can have an appointment  get all the codes prior  know the codes are covered and in your plan  and they can still decide to code something in a certain way that isn t covered  and nobody has to tell you  That s why getting any care is Russian roulette  Nobody is legally obligated to tell you what you re going to have to pay  and what you may have to pay is subject to change  No idea how this is all legal  but it is  So  yes  you do need to lie  or  you need to go only to an lgbt clinic where they will likely understand and not code you that way talk to your doctor about that concern prior to anything else  You have to be very pro active and know your stuff to not get charged      for a basic  covered appt  and unfortunately you often need to learn that the hard way  I would personally fight the coding and see if you qualify for financial aide  Sorry this happened,-1.0

2024-12-04,Medicaid would NOT pay if your primary insurance denied no matter how many letters the billing office sends  I was in insurance billing for decades and I can assure you of this  Yes  the person on the phone was wrong  Unfortunately that is not uncommon  Frankly if one insurance is denying I would be surprised if any insurance covers the surgery  If you want to have the surgery look into other options for paying for it,-1.0
2024-12-17,Worse  Their denial rate is absolutely ridiculous  Many hours are spent on claims going through the reconsideration appeal process that end up getting paid without one single piece of information being changed or corrected    Real example from personal experience  Surgery A requires a pre authorization  PA is obtained and on the patient chart  Surgery A is performed  claim is filed with PA attached appropriately  Claim is denied for no PA  Our first level of response is to send it through their provider electronic portal for reconsideration  We point out that the claim was filed correctly  the procedure performed matches what was pre authorized  attach documents to show proof  and wait  They deny again stating they are  upholding their original determination   Our next step is to file an appeal through their provider portal  We attach the exact same documentation that was filed with the ORIGINAL claim  and site all the same points as in the reconsideration request and magically now the claim gets paid  Happens ALL the time,-1.0
2024-12-04,Well  that would be retaliation and a whole additional legal issue for them    but I get it    I mean your choices are    accept the changes with no protesting     or don t accept them and go speak to an attorney about options    You can ask them why the      plan is no longer an option for        going forward    and you can ask them if there are any other plan options you d be allowed to select    or if you can now cancel your coverage since you didn t want the      plan to begin with   but your options are to accept this change or not accept this change,-1.0

2024-12-03,I had a similar issue   Surgery in New York   Neuro monitoring company OON with all insurances   They billed my insurance           Almost   times the amount the neurosurgeon billed   It was denied twice by my insurance due to coding issues   My EOB stated I am responsible for         and I nearly had a heart attack    About a year later they sent me a letter asking my permission for them to appeal to my insurance   It been    months and they haven t billed me directly yet,-1.0
2024-11-27,Unfortunately the way insurance does things is to benefit not the patient nor the hospital  but the insurance company  Likely your Healthcare providers will have to send documentation and insurance will inevitably cover more  Its annoying af nevause yes  it s very common sense that OHS requires more than one day in hospital    I ve had several back and forth with my insurance and previously worked as a nurse so I am way too familiar with how freaking annoying it is lol    Best wishes for your surgery and I hope you can feel a little less overwhelmed  I recommend speaking to the doctor about it too if you can  They will be able to reassure you better im sure,-1.0

2024-11-22,My state  and presumably all states  have great Insurance Commissioners  That is where you go once you have exhausted IN HOUSE complaints  that is  they deny something  you appeal or file a grievance  they write back to a way to  up  the complaint  and then if THAT is denied  you go outside to the state government   It s even listed on my insurance appeal forms that that is where I can go next    BTW   I did that once and it worked  for a second item it did NOT work because the person i got at the insurance commissioner s office was friends with the specific name I had from the insurance company  So I took the final step   I filed in small claims court and I won  No lawyer  minimal cost,-1.0

2024-12-17,What the CSR told you isn t worth anything unfortunately    I absolutely loathe insurance companies and how they operate and more importantly exploit vulnerable people  The runaround and misinformation you were provided is part of the reason I hate them so much  The CSRs   never   explain to customers that a prior authorization is required when people call to ask if things are covered and all it does is set up a person for failure thinking their insurance is going to cover something and then they blame the doctors office when it isn t because  the insurance company told me it s covered   This is a part of their  deny  delay  defend  strategy to wear people down    Having said that  I would be shocked if a vasectomy is covered by any insurance  I would just assume it s out of pocket for nearly any circumstance  But if they were a reputable company they would have just told you that up front instead of making you think you had a verbal authorization,-1.0

2024-12-16,The funniest thing is that most insurers just list every single doctor as in network  so you have to call literally every single doctor to find out if they re in network or not  Half the time they don t know  Or half the time  Molina  will be in network but since you ended up with the plan that no doctors are actually in network for  you don t find out until you get billed,-1.0

2024-11-24,As long as you don t develop anything while uninsured that could be considered a pre existing condition  Under current law they can t do this  but it used to be that insurance companies could refuse to cover anything related to a pre existing condition  Since the current administration wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act  that could be allowed again soon   I know it s a budget killer  but I d do the HSA plan  or at least look into it further  Mine  not a marketplace plan  gives me      year for completing free preventative screenings like mammograms and pap  and contributes        year to my HSA  An HSA is yours for life  so if the      mo plan does something similar  at least you ll know part of your premiums is being saved for future expenses,0.0

2024-12-07,You are dealing with one of the BIGGEST ISSUES and COMPLAINTS of the Health Insurance Market and plans   This is a LONG story but in short     Each Insurance Company creates  designs  and prices their insurance policies on their own   It is sort of like going into a coffee shop and ordering a small  medium  or large coffee   The company sets the price and how much coffee goes into each cup mug      The Insurance commissioner of your State then Decides if the plan is good enough or not good enough to sell with in the states borders   They also determine what the COST of that plan can be   Using our coffee Example  the state has the power to say NO  the medium coffee is to costly  and it does not include sugar  Drop the price and add sugar to it and you can sell it in our state      The PPO part of the plan  Prefered Provider Organization      years ago I worked for  PPO in both the Customer Service and Provider Services area   To sign up just   doctor took at least a full    days to complete the process  I am pretty sure times have changed  and it s a bit quicker these days   However  one thing to keep in mind   No Doctor or Medical Provider who accepts the insurance carrier as a payor is required to sign up with the PPO Organization of that insurance company    It s also possible that in a Medical Group that has some    doctors or specialists in it  only some of those doctors are signed up with the PPO portion   As a result in just one medical group  some doctors may be in the network while others are not   The PPO itself is usually designed for those enrollees who are in that state   My plan through my employer is great  tons of doctors  and clinics and I can go anywhere I want   But if I were to go to a Hospital say in NY or Boston or Texas I would be out of network  and subject to all the deductibles and max out of pocket expenses   Some PPO Plans that are available do offer LIMITED PPO benefits if you are out of state   However for the      enrollment Bigger Wider Spectrum was slashed quite drastically  and is only beneficial if you have a Medial Emergency  See provider with in the network   There could be a plan you could enroll it  however  I doubt if you would find that plan on the States Health Insurance Exchange  you would need to buy the policy directly from the Insurance Carrier via a licensed insurance broker   I would suggest speaking to one,0.0

2024-11-20,Do you mean purchasing the same plan instead of COBRA or do you mean using COBRA for as long as possible and then being able to continue with the same plan   The short answer is that you can t do it because COBRA is essentially your employer s  group plan  which you can continue to receive  The difference is that you must pay the entire cost of the premium since employer has no obligation to subsidy it   It is a a relic of the years before the passage of the ACA when being fired from a job often meant someone would then be without any insurance and no ability to purchase it  For many people COBRA was a life line since they had an extended period of time in which to get another job which theoretically would provide them with insurance   With the passage of ACA and the marketplace providing coverage for pre existing conditions as well as the expansion of Medicaid  COBRA has become less critical  Many people don t use it as an option since they find out the cost is prohibitive especially when compared with a premium subsidy or Medicaid    Of course some people want to continue with COBRA because often the benefits are so much better  However those very good benefits are generally only available because they are group plans and not available other than through employers for a variety of reasons   You can attempt to purchase directly from an insurer rather than the marketplace  However unless one is very knowledgable and or using a very good agent  it is a potential mine field in which one would wind up with  not health insurance,0.0

2024-11-21,Major insurance companies and managed care organizations for programs like Medicaid have systems that process claims    Sometimes humans look them over before the final claim issues  sometimes not   mainly depends on what the claim is for  For example  high dollar claims that pay out hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars are looked at by a payment integrity team to review and approve the payment  There are also instances when manual pricing is needed by a human because of how the services are paid  For example  anesthesia payments are calculated based on the number of minutes that the anesthesia was given  This may require a human to review at some companies depending on how the system is set up   But really  a lot of claims are so basic that it wouldn t make sense for a human to do it  In these instances  it is basically the insurance company paying a flat rate of X for every Y service billed  There are always audits of claims and claim systems by humans to make sure things are running smoothly  though,-1.0

2024-11-22,Unfortunately  this denial sounds correct based upon what you ve provided  Sorry OP  it s due to a very nuanced distinction between  vision screening  and  vision exam   A vision screening is usually done by your child s pediatrician as part of their yearly annual wellness visit  This is a quick visual test to quickly screen for potential vision issues  If an issue is discovered  e g   need for eyeglasses   then your pediatrician will refer your child for a vision exam with an optometrist opthalmologist  A vision screening is reported as CPT                A vision exam  which sounds like what your child had  is a dedicated visit solely to evaluate vision issues  For example  if your child needs eyeglasses  they will see an optometrist to get prescribed a pair  The vision exam  e g   checking for glaucoma  checking eye movement  etc   is reported as CPT       or        The refraction  which is used to report determining the eyeglasses prescription   is reported as        Most medical plans by most employer groups do not cover a vision exam as a preventative benefit  They require you to purchase separate vision insurance for that benefit    Your benefit book specifically states that optometry is an excluded benefit except when performed in an otherwise covered preventative service  That means  your plan covers vision screening  the               codes I listed above   It doesn t cover the                     codes    You didn t mention why your child had this preventative exam  Was it because they had acuity issues and needed eyeglasses contacts  Or was it because there was a concern for a medical issue  e g   glaucoma  diabetic vision exam  amblyopia    If it was a vision exam for eyeglasses  my only suggestion would be to ask your provider to change the billed CPT code from                      to either S      if you were a new patient  or S      if you were an established patient   Sometimes  payer benefit systems aren t sophisticated enough to handle these less commonly billed codes and maybe you get lucky and these are covered as a preventative benefit  You might get push back from your provider if you ask to bill this way  but it s worth a shot   If the vision exam was for a medical concern  you can ask your provider to change their billing so that instead of billing              they bill an appropriate E M visit code                  If they bill this way  they will have to bill with a primary diagnosis that your insurer would consider medical  e g   diabetes  glaucoma  etc    If billed this way  the visit would fall under your specialist office benefit  and any applicable copay deductible coinsurance would apply  However  hopefully what you owe would end up being less than the full charged amount  Unfortunately  the refraction would remain a non covered benefit if it was performed and be your responsibility    Sorry I don t have better advice for you OP  hope this helps though,0.0

2024-11-23,Hello friend   Take a deep breath  you ll get through this    Yes  there is subsidy cap repayment  KFF  Kaiser Foundation and a very trusted resource for these things  has a great article on this here   https   www kff org faqs faqs health insurance marketplace and the aca whats the most i would have to repay the irs   https   www kff org faqs faqs health insurance marketplace and the aca whats the most i would have to repay the irs    If you end up in a situation where you make less than      of the federal poverty level  the CAP on your subsidy repayment is only      for single taxpayer status    You re further along than most who come asking this question   best thing to do is see if you can increase your income  promotion or salary adjustment at work  side gig  etc   Anything you can do to keep your income above the threshold for a subsidy in your state is going to help you avoid having the repayment for next year    I do caution you to try your hardest next year to not end up in the same situation  The only downside to the cap on repayment is that if you need to use it several times  they could take away your ability to use the subsidy ahead of time  So  really get out and try to make that minimum income necessary    It is unfortunate that    states have still opted out of expanded medicaid as it leaves hard working folks in a similar situation to you   stuck between a rock and a hard plance  but I think it s nice that there s a cap on repayment       is what some people pay for one month of coverage at work or  healthcare gov  http   healthcare gov  iteself    so at least there s SOMETHING helping curb costs,0.0

2024-11-23,Minor point to your very good post  but I and my family did not have work insurance EVER  not one year  and we were never on Medicaid   This isn t to dispute you personally but just to add to the knowledge base if anyone else reads this   We   always   had insurance despite not having it through work because there always seemed to be some sort of voluntary group we could join  from college grad school insurance to groups for small businesses  societies   or whatever   For some years  many in my extended family were able to buy  catastrophic  insurance  Politicians called this  junk insurance  but it was no different than today s Marketplace HD plans  Without subsidies  my son s deductible is        before it kicks in on the marketplace  His pre marketplace catastrophic plan kicked in at          The way it is better today is that you can put the deductible in an HSA  back then we just kept it in a regular account   We also always had insurance for our daughter with a pre existing condition  which some people say was impossible before the Marketplace   Our state had a high risk pool for those people  as did most  and though it was pricey  even putting it through an inflation calculator it is not much more than a policy today  without subsidies   The subsidies are the big advantage today  though they are extremely hard on small business owners  who pay super high rates to subsidize the subsidies  My brother in law pays       a month  They were originally meant to be subsidized by the US taking over student loans from the banks  but with so many loans forgiven and with increases in insurance costs  that s not enough  So some win  some lose,-1.0

2024-11-23,This is basically a high deductible HSA combo but with a PPO network instead of a more limited EPO or HMO network   You put pre tax dollars into the HSA to then pay for your medical costs up to your deductible  and after if anything is left    This way it usually ends up costing less than post tax dollars  You also get the  insurance rate  for procedures and medications  which are sometimes cheaper than the cash price    You should read the fine print to see if anything else is covered before deductible  but generally nothing is except certain ACA required checkups and maybe vaccines   If there is money left over on an HSA at the end of the year  it carries over to the next year  so I would suggest you load it up with a good amount of contributions to begin with and raise the amount if you need more   You can lower contributions later  if desired   Also check to see if your company matches contributions and or puts in seed money   PPO is the best type of network to be in because it is the most expansive set of doctors hospitals facilities to choose from,0.0

2024-11-25,I don t think one size fits all   Many people would qualify for a subsidy on the marketplace so their cost for premiums would be significantly lower   If they have children it is possible that the children would be able to be insured through CHIPS even if income is too high for regular Medicaid   Many people don t have much need of medical care and need insurance to protect against catastrophic medical expenses so they can opt for a high deductible plan which would have a lower premium   In general COBRA plans with really good benefits have extremely high premiums and a  good  employer is providing a significant subsidy for employees  This is especially true if it is a large employer and one who is self funding   I think the people who need to continue with COBRA are those who have significant medical issues and or are in the middle of treatment or pregnancy and so it is worth it to have excellent coverage whatever the cost   Of course in the future COBRA might be the only option for people   especially those with pre existing conditions,0.0

2024-11-26,The  fixing  of the family glitch says that if the spouse   dependent coverage offered by an employer doesn t meet the  affordable  threshold  the spouse   dependents are eligible for the tax credits on the ACA marketplace  and the employer is not fined    But as long as the employee s coverage is affordable  the employee is not eligible for the tax credit   and if the employee applies with the spouse   dependent on the marketplace  they can cause the entire family to lose the tax credit    There s probably a lot of additional factors to consider in this equation though  Going from a      contractor to a W  employee   are you getting full benefits  including retirement contributions  Will it be salaried or hourly  Is your annual income going to change  Since your employer is now paying payroll taxes  does that make up for the higher insurance cost  I d make sure to evaluate all scenarios   even talking to a certified financial planner or someone well versed in HR benefits for an objective view,0.0

2024-11-26,To answer some of your questions  Obamacare is the unofficial name for the ACA  Medicaid is a different program altogether  My understanding is that medicaid is generally for poor people who cannot afford insurance and it is government run  The ACA regulates what private health insurance providers have to provide to their customers  It also requires that they provide health insurance to people with pre existing conditions and it provides subsidies for those with lower incomes  Healthcare gov is the website used to search for and purchase an healthcare insurance policy that meets the ACA standards   If you currently do not have insurance you ought to shop for insurance on healthcare gov  You may qualify for a subsidy so why not get insurance while you can and while it may be less expensive,0.0

2024-11-26,First  that is AWESOME if your company contributed to your HSA  You are sure it s not your health insurance premium  You probably have two separate line items  one for your health insurance premium  even if they cover all of your premium  and then one for the HSA deduction   Usually you can t randomly contribute to your HSA through your paycheck  It s a set amount you select that comes out every pay period  But you can submit a special request for it to change to your benefits team   Anthem can tell you only about your health insurance plan  They should have sent you a little card  aka ID card  with some information on it  They might also have sent you a packet to log into their app or website  You can see your health insurance claims  They won t know anything about your HSA because that s a deal your employer made   Your workplace handbook or benefits portal should have some information in the benefits section about who your HSA company is  it will be another company   Each pay period the employer takes your deduction pretax and sends it to them   You ll get it figured out  The other piece of advice  Invest your HSA money and pay cash for general healthcare expenses to let the HSA grow  I probably contributed a total of         to my HSA over a period of   years  Had a couple of years with hitting my insurance s out of pocket maximum so used it to pay for those           and still have close to         invested today  Basically have made over         profit having invested it instead of using it  And neither my initial investment or my growth will ever be taxed as long as it s used for healthcare  Just save your receipts digitally  some HSA companies let you do this on their web portals   then you can reimburse yourself anytime in the future,0.0

2024-11-27,The issue is adverse selection  Because an HSA compatible plan has a lower Maximum Out Of Pocket  MOOP  limit than traditional plans  they tend to be purchased by people with high cost chronic conditions who know their annual medical costs will exceed the MOOP  On the flip side  the high deductible discourages healthier shoppers  who figure they won t even meet their deductible so they won t get enough benefit out of the plan  So the population that buys HSA plans on exchange tend to be riskier higher cost than in traditional designs      When you combine that with the requirement that plans be priced as a  single risk pool  and carriers can t fully price for the incremental risk in just that product type  it makes it easier for most carriers to just not offer them   Carriers that do offer them often put them on more expensive networks so they can price them higher than their more value oriented offerings,0.0

2024-11-28,Thank you so much for responding  To answer your question  I added my son to my Anthem policy on the day he was born   That said  your response adds to the confusion and frustration I ve been dealing with  Every time I call  I feel like we re starting from scratch  having to explain the entire situation all over again  Each agent seems to interpret the newborn mandate differently  and nothing seems to get resolved  Here s where things stand   Since September  Anthem has been denying these claims  citing  prior coverage  on file for my son at the time of his birth  I ve repeatedly explained that my son was never covered by United or any other policy and every time  the agent would  make a note  in the system to be sent to the appropriate team  But despite those assurances  nothing changed  and Anthem continued to deny the claims for the same reason   In mid October  an Anthem agent set up a three way call with United  where the United rep confirmed that my son was never covered under their policy  The Anthem agent seemed to think that was enough to settle the issue  and we thought so too  But even after that confirmation was noted in Anthem s system  the claims were still denied for prior coverage   Then  a few weeks ago  a different Anthem agent told me that the previous agent was incorrect  and that under the newborn mandate  United should have covered my son for the first    days as an extension of my wife s policy  To follow up  my wife had another three way call with Anthem and United  where United s agent also confirmed this interpretation  The United rep told my wife to have the providers send them the claims  and because of the newborn mandate  they would take care of it  Once again  we thought the issue was finally resolved   But now this latest roadblock  with United saying they can t process the claims for that period because Anthem s coverage began on my son s date of birth  so they won t cover the same time period if another insurer is listed   So here s my question  If the newborn mandate doesn t actually obligate United to cover those    days  how do I get Anthem to process these claims  The confusion comes from the fact that a United rep confirmed Anthem s understanding of the mandate  which seemed to validate that Anthem was correct all along   And if Anthem really does need to pay these claims  how can I convince them to take action  It feels like this issue keeps getting passed between low level employees  none of whom have the authority or understanding to make progress  And because I have no knowledge of any of this  I m left to just trust that they know what they re doing  which they clearly don t   How do I finally break this cycle and get it resolved once and for all,-1.0

2024-11-29,I am a nurse  and I work at a busy multispecialty clinic  We have four endocrinologists and one pediatric endocrinologist  We accept PPO plan and one HMO plan  optimum    The referral paper is not equal to an authorization form  The authorization comes from your HMO plan  It doesn t take that long to get all done and you would get that in the mail   For our clinic we make sure the authorization is approved before the patient comes in  The front desk receptionist go through the schedule about a week in advance to make sure everything is authorized  We do not want to see the patient without the authorization in place because they will end up getting the bill   You have fallen through the cracks  Your PCP office need to stay on top of this  You can also reach out to your insurance  hopefully if you have the website access  to see if your referral was approved  It is extremely rare that such a referral is not approved    When you go in  arrive early because you could have pages of documents you may have to complete  Bring all your medications with you and all over the counter stuff as well  While we do have the link electronically to your pharmacies  it is best to bring in what you have  If you have a copy of your last visit to your PCP  bring that  as well  If your PCP office is on top of it  they should have sent the endocrinologist office a copy of that  along with all the lab tests  already  If you are seen for osteoporosis  make sure you have a copy of the bone density  as well  You get that from your x ray radiology office   If they are going to repeat your lab  go in that day fasting if you can  You will not have to come back another day   I assume that you are good with the Internet as you are here   take their offer to sign up for the patient portal  My job at the office is not to bring in the patient from the waiting room into the exam room   I answer the email messages from the patient and telephone calls  It is much more time consuming to deal with the phone  I would rather do the email  It s for questions when the patient does not need an actual appointment or refill request   If you get put on expensive  newer diabetes medication you will need a prior authorization  If your insurance denied it your office may not appeal that decision   I do that for our office   If your income is low enough look up the Internet on   medication s name patient assistant program   You will get that medication for free   Best wishes to you   This note was created with Dragon Medical  a voice recognition software  Occasional incorrect words may have occurred due to the inherent limitations,0.0

2024-11-29,To be frank  you really can t  Insurances don t make promises before they see the actual claim   with the codes  dates  providers  etc  that actually will be on it   because even one small change can result in a completely different result of covered not and how it s covered  So rather than deal with angry people who don t understand  what you asked us about is not what you actually had done  or  you didn t tell us it was early and so us saying it was covered was based on it being due     they just don t make those promises in a binding way  i e  in writing   or they heavily hedge them with fine print conditions of  this is based on the information provided and final determination will be made when the claim is filed    What doesn t make sense here is that a  diagnostic  colonoscopy generally shouldn t have a waiting period  so long as the reason it is being done is medically justifiable   In other words  you can t just go get a colonoscopy every month when you re still having the same symptoms etc    but if you ve had a change in your symptoms etc that makes a new colonoscopy justifiable  i e  that they re looking for something else  and or that there s more reason to believe they ll find something   your insurance should pay for it   Your doctor may be able to file for a pre auth with your insurance explaining the circumstances   or they may not be  But if your doctor is willing to postpone it  then it sounds like they know they can t justify it medically,0.0

2024-12-02,Is your HSA eligible plan also Kaiser   It s hard to read the way you listed the comparison out so I m not parsing details  Lists and not paragraph style would be helpful  But my initial instinct is to stick with the HMO as the premium difference is not that significant and the out of pocket cost differences are significant  Remember you will pay for some of those services more fully until you hit the deductible  Sure you could get some good tax benefits from the HSA  but as someone who is healthy in my   s I d personally pick the HMO in this situation  The price difference isn t significant  you d possibly end up paying more for care or foregoing care because it costs more  If it s not Kaiser you d have to find all new providers  maybe including therapist    The disruption and change don t seem worth the tax benefits to me since there aren t significant up front savings from the HDHP    Good luck,0.0

2024-12-03,Yes Ambetter has been a nightmare  I am now having to chose a new plan because the Ambetter plan I was on is no longer available and to make matters worse since open enrollment they stopped authorizing anything for me  Then they lie about not getting paper work from the Cleveland Clinic who got a referral number that they  Ambetter  did receive the paperwork  They also kept telling me that every time my doctor s office sent over in order to get pre authorized that my doctor s office was sending it incorrectly   They would send it repeatedly and repeat repeatedly and Ambetter would say anything just to not have to pay for imaging   And then when you try to call customer service it s in Thailand and they re using a script that they go off of   So they answer you with answers that they re getting off of the script that doesn t quite make sense and there s a definite communication breakdown there   When you re speaking to them  they don t really know what you re saying   It makes it quite difficult to get any type of real help  When you call there I ve never called one time and had any help be done   They just give me the runaround and keep reading me canned answers off of their Scripts  I m tired of this  But I also hear Florida Blue is not much better  Idk what to do as the health care in Florida is so subpar  well it s subpar in the United States to be honest with you   I don t understand why the healthcare industries has as much control as they do and it feels like there are no guidelines or rules they have to follow  it s more like HellCare instead  I have chronic illness that is destroying my joints and makes me feel so ill everyday of my life and I ve been trying like hell for over a year just to get an MRI of my left hip  My right hip is bone on bone has fluid sitting on it  My labrum is shredded and it s been causing me pain for    years  and I m only    so they say I m too young for a hip replacement but yeah  I m sitting here in miserable pain and a lot of times I can barely walk  I ve had three surgeons turned me down because of my age  But from what I ve read  they do have hip replacements that last    years now  Then when I found out  is these surgeons have interest in Pain Management and in physical Therapy so that s what they do  They send you to their other businesses rather than do surgery now  Why do a four hour surgery when you can just send patients to all your other businesses  It s just unfair  I don t know how much longer I can continue living like this  I promise the only thing that s keeping me here is that I have a relationship with God because if I didn t  I would take myself out of my pain and misery,-1.0

2024-12-03,I want to thank you SO much for sharing this  My search was just about one trip but I an planning on doing some digital nomad movement next year and had not thought about overseas health insurance for that  Kicking myself for not thinking of this sooner especially because I had a nasty  weeks long ER visit and hospital stay overseas on a work trip  that job fully covered me for personal and work trips for the years I was in it but I m on my own now   Glad I saw this  GeoBlue has great rates too   cheaper for me to cover multi trips for a year than pay the travel agent trip insurance for this one trip I was thinking about  Thanks again,0.0

2024-12-03,What do you mean by  pocket    Let s say an employer is fully insured  they pay the insurance company    m in premium for all of       If all the claims   administrative fees only end up coming in at     M  the insurance company keeps that     k  nothing is refunded back to the employer    However  if all the claims   administrative fees come in at    M  the insurer absorbs that cost  they can t go back to the employer and demand more money    Regardless of what the actual claims are  the employer will only ever pay    M in premium   In both fully insured situations  the insurance company is on the hook and makes all the payments to the providers facilities   When an employer decides to self insure  they basically tell the insurance company to do everything exactly the same as fully insured  EXCEPT the employer is on the hook for all the claims  The insurance company will pay the providers facilities  and then instantly request funds from the employer s bank account    To your original question  if you re comparing a fully insured cost of    M vs a self insured cost of     m  then yes the employer has  saved      k in example one  However  in example    the employer would be responsible for the    M  which would be   M more expensive than fully insured,0.0

2024-12-04,Covid may have had a role in your first issue  I m a Medicaid residential provider for the intellectually disabled and things were all sorts of messed up because during the Covid PHO  Medicaid was not allowed to set end dates and therefore  didn t set a redetermination date  It wasn t until the Covid wind down that they started this up again  This became a huge problem end up last year beginning of this year because in the   years we were in the pandemic  lots of people s situations change  People move  people die  people lost jobs got better income  etc  and everyone either forgot to update their info or the state just forgot about them  I believe the number of people who lost their coverage due to bureaucratic nonsense was something over         and if you lost it  getting back on was almost impossible due to the over whelming numbers and the unbelievably understaffed Medicaid offices  They may have sent your letter to an old address but if you kept everything updated  you have have fallen victim to Medicaid just forgetting to send you stuff because they were overwhelmed,0.0

2024-12-04,OP  a lot of good advice here  An additional thought would be to get better clarity from your primary payer to determine the liability if the authorized service was performed  and if your surgeon filed a claim  Specifically  you need to figure out whether your primary insurance would deny as either member liability or provider liability  How your primary payer denies could also impact how Medicaid processes the claim   To elaborate with some examples  your primary payer might deny as a  not medically necessary  denial  which is a CO     CO   Contractual Obligation  denial  provider liability  Medicaid would generally not pay on that as secondary  since primary denied to the provider and Medicaid views it as a provider write off   However  it s also possible your primary payer would deny as member liability  For example  they might deny as PR     services denied at time authorization was requested  or deny PR     procedure treatment drug is considered investigational by the payer   PR   patient responsibility  and Medicaid would at least consider these charges  but still doesn t guarantee that they pay them    Once you learn how your primary payer would deny  if patient liability  you can maybe use that information to please your case back to the provider and ask them to send a prior auth to Medicaid  As others have said though  this still wouldn t guarantee payment to the provider even if Medicaid authorizes,0.0

2024-12-04,The only reason I m considering this one is because there is no waiting period  So  if I can use it up and cancel right after  it ll probably save me           after     months of premium paid  and if it actually can work that way    Otherwise with typical plans you re right  like if I need a crown with an   th month wait  like I can even wait that long and still have a tooth or jaw left   you paid much of your benefit in premium before you even get anything  and then it s still only     coinsurance  so barely worth it  But  if you don t knowingly need a crown now  who knows when if you will  so odds are you probably pay the whole benefit in premium before needing the service  Probably not worth it,0.0

2024-12-04,Couple of things with dual coverage      The plan you have for yourself  where you are the member  not the dependent  is going to be primary  So your work plan will be primary to your spouse s plan  You need to make sure that you don t mix this up  You can t just use the secondary plan when you d like to  and skip primary        You will want to make sure you inform both insurance companies that you have dual coverage  So they know if they are primary or secondary  This will help if your claim gets sent to secondary first on accident  but not a guarantee       As hinted in number     when you have dual coverage  you need to be monitoring your claims to make sure that primary is paying first and secondary is paying second  If there is an error in this  notify insurance immediately so they can get it corrected  I ve had clients who had secondary process and pay for a claim   but primary never saw it or didn t get it  This never plays out well for the insured  When secondary figures out they paid primary  and they will eventually figure it out  could be immediately  could be years from now  they ll claw back the paymennt and it will leave you with the full bill in your hands as if you had no insurance if it s been too long to submit the claim to the rightful primary       How useful dual coverage is depends heavily on the Coordination of Benefits Clause in the secondary policy s contract  Some are more generous  but some are very stingy  We see several gotchas  like secondary may deny the claim if primary denies the claim    even if it s something secondary would cover if they were the only insurance  In this situation  you d want to make sure you were in network for both policies  especially if one policy doesn t have out of network benefits  Also  most CoB clauses don t duplicate benefits   meaning  it s not as if secondary would pay     of what is left after primary processes the claim  Secondary may see that primary already paid a large portion  and then decline to coverage anything more    So  in summary  read the CoB clause in the secondary policy and be familiar with how they handle processing claims as secondary  Also  if you re not the type to follow up and check on claims regularly  dual coverage is not for you   FUTHER  since your work plan is an HDHP plan  If your husband s plan is not an official HSA eligible HDHP plan too  you won t be able to contribute to or recieve employer contributions towards an HSA as your husband s plan would be disqualifying coverage for you  You didn t mention specifically if the options included an HSA eligible plan for your husband  but if you plan to continue recieving contributions or making contributions to an HSA  all of your coverages must be HDHP HSAs,0.0

2024-12-04,years working with the ACA and solving enrollment issues  If you have Health Insurance through your employer then most likely that plan is affordable to you and you should not terminate that plan     If you are going to reduce your hours and no longer be eligible for the Employer Pan  ESI   then you may be eligible to enroll in the Health Insurance Marketplace   HOWEVER  be warmed  You will only be eligible for APTC  most likely if your parents do not claim you as a tax dependent on their IRS tax return        If they do claim you  then most likely between their income and your income you will be over the threshold for eligibility for Tax Credits  APTC  and will need to pay the full cost for the plan   If your Parents don t claim you as a dependent  and you file single  not married  you would be eligible for APTC  you may OVER report your income as long as you are not attempting to avoid a MEDICAID eligibility   In the    years of doing what I do  there have only been a handful of cases where the state went after the individuals for accepting APTC and not the MEDICAID eligibility   somewhere around   cases brought on by the State s Attorney General   So it is serious   You may over report your income by about     perhaps      anything higher could potentially raise a red flag which could trigger an investigation   The odds are most likely NOT but you should be aware of the consequences   An Income of about         should make you eligible for APTC  and a Cost Sharing Reduction  CSR  and you could be paying as little as    to     per month for your health insurance through the market place,0.0

2024-12-04,Yeah  the UHC rep who told you that is completely inappropriate and that s literally not how insurance works at all  Also  UHC is one of the most ridiculous insurance companies when it comes to their greed and money ain t no way they re just willing to pay for uninsured people out of the goodness of their hearts  Seriously though please understand that this is not how insurance works   Yes  your insurance should only reflect your billed amount and services rendered  but if it s not coming from the hospital  something went wrong on the insurance side  Insurance companies don t just add extra services because they feel like it  And when two claims images get mixed together  sometimes people miss it because they failed to look at the second or third page where the name changes on the top of the claim because in theory that shouldn t be the case  Customer service reps also usually don t have access to see claims images  The claims department would need to review that and somebody who actually cares about their job to carefully review it  And once it s on your record it      can come off in an auditable way  They would have to back out the claim their systems version of hide it and enter only the correct information and re process  The fact that they denied your appeal is odd however  again it takes one person being overworked and or not very good at their job  The hospital themselves should also be working to resolve this because this would create an excess money in their system  They won t have anywhere to put it  It ll create an imbalance also contractually they re not allowed to keep money They know they are not owed,-1.0

2024-12-04,Wow  my only guess is maybe those   providers are somehow all affiliated with the same provider and or hospital group  and it s the provider group s policy to collect this payment up front  that still sounds wack to me  Maybe I could see them wanting to do this closer to the delivery date  but it s impossible to determine where you are going to be in your deductible OOP accumulations on your delivery date     months away at your first pre natal visit   Full disclosure though  I m a gay male  so I don t really have a clue what the  industry standard  is for maternity care on the provider side  I m just speaking to how these claims should generally be billed and adjudicated by your insurance,0.0

2024-12-05,I d suggest you call and prod them   As a general rule  insurance companies are far more receptive to subscribers than they are providers   If you can either be in the office with the provider or have them on the line with you  that s even better because then the provider can answer any questions that the insurance may have   Also make sure things aren t waiting on the provider   For an SCA  there s usually a little negotiation between the provider and insurer  so it can t hurt to make sure the provider didn t miss something too,0.0

2024-12-06,years working within the ACA and solving Enrollment issues   Each state is slightly different but the rules in general are the same  however  each marketplace may run its marketplace differently so I can only tell you what would happen in my state  not CA   You enrolled for an effective date of                               All plans start on the first of the month  and all plans end on the last day of the month      Terming plans mid month is only done in the event of the death of an individual  Let s assume that you completed the application in November  and the transaction was sent to the insurance carrier that you picked   Then on December    you updated your income  which changed the APTC rate causing an increase in the premium   Since it is after the   th of November but after December    the rate would only effect the premium moving forward to January   However since January is a new plan year  the new rate is not really valid   It would only be the rate you were quoted for the      enrollment which should have increased   The Insurance company will most likely at this point bill you the amount that you signed up for   That is how our state exchange system works   Yours may be different   If the reported change occurred and the carrier is going to bill you the difference then  in my state     You are responsible for paying the premium  if you don t  Your policy may be termed for nonpayment   and at that point  any medical claims would be denied   the exchange can not reinstate you  you need to appeal to the carrier directly for a reinstatement due to nonpay         Failing to pay could lead to the carrier doing   of   things      writing off the balance or      Bringing you to collections  Again because the exchange does not do the financial transaction its between you and the carrier   The exchange only determines your eligibility for the tax credits  the exchange does not and should not request any banking information from you  period      Failing to pay leading to a nonpayment could result in an enrollment for January      being termed due to non payment because you failed to pay the bill from the previous enrollment   In your case  if this case was ESCALATED we here in my state would grant a RETRO termination to            to void out the policy   I don t know what the state of California s policies are because each state can set up its policies and procedures for dealing with situations like this,0.0

2024-12-06,Run for Congress  as they get very good socialized medicine for the rest of their lives  Or get a CEO position    My family is fairly well off  Both of our employers offer health insurance  so we were able to look at the plans offered and pick the best one for our family between them  We chose hubby s  because his company pays the entirety of the cost of the insurance  and does not require them to use a management company that has access to our health records as the insurance my employer offers uses  What is supposed to happen is that we pay a reasonable co pay for most doctors office visits and prescription meds  and then after we reach the deductible  they pay       Emergency room and urgent care visits we are supposed to get charged a lot for  I think something like     of cost  unless the insurance company deems them a legitimate use    Supposed is carrying a lot of weight in that sentence    What actually happens is that we pay the copays  and then for every single visit  and daughter goes to therapy    x a month  I have autoimmune and retinal issues which means that on top of my twice yearly GP visits I also have to see specialists  x a year  they send us a letter in the mail asking us if we have any other insurance  We don t  we never have doubled up on insurance  but EVERY VISIT we still get this letter  and if we don t fill out the form and send it back within a very strict time limit  they just have no other choice but to assume that we used this mysterious other insurance we have and bill us for the whole cost and tell us to recoup it from the other insurance we must have used    On several occasions  this letter didn t show up at our house  and we still got billed    Also  they deny everything  even stuff they explicitly say that they cover  just hoping that you don t fight it  They ve denied a strep test for my kid even though it was positive  They tried to deny the payment on my most recent emergency room visit as being unnecessary even though it led DIRECTLY to my having an emergency appendectomy  Apparently  I could have waited until Monday and just seen my regular doctor  They denied covering an important eye exam to determine what was causing my retinal issues  etc  and so on  Every time we have to fight them  it s    hours waiting on the phone to talk to anyone  And again  this is  very good insurance     The entire insurance industry is a scam that exists to pull profit out of the health system without providing any real service  We are the ONLY  developed  nation that doesn t have some form of universal health care  It s insane,-1.0

2024-12-06,Hi  I have a million thoughts on this so bear with me  Feel free to ask whatever other questions you have    I gave birth   years ago and didn t know global billing was a thing  I m due with my second in May and just faced this for the first time myself  I m realizing this practice was put in place because people tend to not pay their bills for childbirth and so the pre payment global billing system helps protect the OB office to ensure they get paid for their part of delivering your child    Them putting you on a plan to meet your deductible is just their best guess at what you might owe them for delivery charges  You will still get a completely separate hospital bill for room and board  bills for medications you receive while giving birth  a bill from anesthesiology for your epidural  etc  and all of that is irrelevant to your global maternity payment plan for the OB  It will cost you a total of           OPP max of          total of           for you next year  Do this same math for all of your other healthcare options and consider picking whatever comes out to be the cheapest    Because of all of these charges you should plan to meet your out of pocket max for       Therefore when picking a plan for next year  you should add the total cost of having insurance  premiums multiplied the number of paychecks you will receive in       to the out of pocket max amount for each of your plan options to determine which will be cheapest  For example  your current plan is        per paycheck  and I ll assume you get paid every   weeks so you ll have    paychecks in         If you pick a new plan for      you can work with the billing dept of your OB office to reallocate your payment plan to accommodate for your new deductible  Once all is said and done and you give birth to your baby and the claims are processed  you should be entitled to either a refund or you may owe a bit more  Just know that you will have to stay on top of them to ensure you get your refund if one is owed to you  Not many doctors offices process refunds automatically    However  that being said  you need to work with HR your insurance company to validate that your OB and the hospital that the OB is contracted to deliver your baby in are in network with all of your plan options  You will be absolutely screwed if you pick a new plan for      and come to find out the OB or hospital are out of network with that new plan  If you haven t already  you should double check with the insurance company that the hospital is in network with your current plan  too  The only way to be      sure of in network status is checking with your insurance company and having them confirm in writing  Don t rely on the receptionist at the OB office or the financial dept at the hospital  they mean well but they can t keep up with the thousands of different medical plans available and which ones are in network  That being said  even if the math makes another plan cheaper  do not switch to that insurance plan if your OB or hospital are out of network with that plan    Also  your child will get billed for services they receive in the hospital  including shots  medicine  pediatrician visits  etc  These bills will not be under your name and will be under your child s name  If you are adamant about adding child to dad s insurance  you also need to check with his insurance provider  again  NOT the hospital  that the hospital is in network  There was a post on here a few weeks ago where the hospital was in network for mom s insurance but not dad s and they added the child to dad s insurance who then denied all of the claims for being out of network and the family is now stuck with a    k bill due to their negligence  If dad s insurance is not in network with the hospital  you need to add the child to mom s insurance when it is born for       again  also assuming you verified through the insurance company that the hospital is in network with mom s insurance     Additionally  there is always a ton of confusion regarding baby s first    days and insurance coverage  Very very rarely  but still happens  the mom s insurance will cover the baby for free for    days no matter what  However  most of the time mom s insurance will begin processing claims as a COURTESY  under the assumption that baby will be added to mom s insurance within the required window  usually    days   You will need to call mom s insurance company  once you decide which plan you re going with for       to determine what coverage they have for the baby  It is most likely that there is only coverage if the baby is physically added to mom s insurance and all of the claims will eventually be denied and the money withdrawn if they are added to dad s insurance  To be clear  you are more than welcome to add baby to dad s insurance  You just need to find out if your plan is part of the       of cases that provides free coverage for baby for    days  regardless  of enrollment so that you know to give the hospital both insurance cards  Otherwise  and most likely  the hospital will only need dad s insurance card for the baby    Another thing you ll need to do is check with dad s HR on the requirements to add baby to his insurance  He will be eligible to add the baby through a  qualifying life event  and it does not happen automatically  His HR dept will require specific paperwork within a specific timeframe to add the baby to his insurance  If he messes this process up your baby will be uninsured for      and all of the hospital claims will be on you guys       Sometimes HR will accept some paperwork from the hospital initially and then require the birth certificate X amount of weeks later when it s available  Make sure you follow the steps all the way through   I think this is everything I wanted to be sure to share lol  Let me know if you have more questions,0.0

2024-12-07,Just to reiterate what has already been said by some on this thread  This is a doctor issue and not an insurance issue  Filing a dispute with your insurance carrier would be a waste of everyone s time    The doctor and or their billing team actively made the decision to bill you for that conversation about the acne  They could have easily not billed the insurance for that very simple conversation but unfortunately some doctors are greedy and or are captured by large hospital systems and incentivized to bill the insurance and obtain as much money as possible    You need to take this up with the doctor office and let them know you did not ask the doctor about the acne that it was something he brought up and that you feel that you were inappropriately charged for that visit  Explain to them that you only scheduled your annual checkup and you will not be paying for that visit  Be nice about it  You catch more flies with honey than vinegar    Good luck,-1.0

2024-12-07,The reality is that your mother would probably be discharged to a skilled nursing facility with any kind of insurance or any insurance company   At this point she doesn t need the kind of intensive medical care offered by a hospital versus the kind of care she can receive at a skilled nursing facility   It is the normal progression and happens to everyone   The rehab at a hospital in terms of PT and OT is not better than the OT and PT she would be receiving at a good skilled nursing faciity rehab facility because that is precisely what the facilities are supposed to do   provided OT and PT for patients being discharged from hospitals because they no longer need the sophisticated medical care of a hospital but still need skilled nursing and or PT and OT   The next hurdle will be when they want to discharge from the SNF because in order to stay in a facility the PT and OT needs to be working in terms of your showing improvement  Medicare pays for only     days of care in a SNF with a Medigap policy and I am assuming Advantage Plans have the same level of benefits   I have been through this with my parents and with some of my elderly neighbors in terms of the progression from hospital to SNF and then discharge from SNF  FWIW you can be discharged from SNF without being able to live independently on one s own which is another scramble in terms of figuring out how to care for an elderly parent who lives alone and doesn t have enough money to hire a full time care person,-1.0

2024-12-07,Plans can be different even through the same company with very similar names   One has to be careful buying off the exchange because it is theoretically possible to get snookered into something that isn t really health insurance   And as you posted  the only way to get health insurance premium subsidy is purchasing through the marketplace   That said  if one is sophisticated and knowledgable and or has a very ethical and knowledgeable agent there might be an objective reason to not purchase through the marketplace  But one has to be very careful when doing this and I think there should be some reason why a person is opting for this route,0.0
2024-12-07,Childbirth will result in both facility and professional fees  Anytime you are at the hospital you will be billed a facility fee for the use of the facility  supplies  medication  overhead costs etc  and you will be billed professional fees which are the fees for the services the doctors provide  A typical childbirth will result in a   day admission  They usually will discharge you within    hours of birth if there are no complications  But   days is not outside of the realm of possibilities even without major complications  I was induced on a Wednesday  delivered on Friday and kept until Sunday and the only complication I had was that I spiked a fever due to prolonged labor and had IV antibiotics as a precaution    Now you ll want to also account for all prenatal visits  I m not sure how far along she is but there are quite a few visits during pregnancy and if she has gestational diabetes  even the healthiest of people can get this  don t assume she won t  or gestational hypertension  again  do not assume she won t get this based on pre pregnancy health  then there will be additional visits and potentially       non stress tests towards the end of pregnancy which will result in specialist visits or if she s like me then the non stress tests will be done twice a week in the maternity department and will produce a facility fee and a professional fee each time    Lots to consider and you should probably just assume that you re going to meet the out of pocket max next year  If you don t  then even better,0.0

2024-12-07,I m a consultant in a related space  Here s an actual answer to your question    One of the primary drivers of this is something called rebates  Made legal on      by Congress in an attempt to control Medicaid spending  But popularized by commercial medical plans    Rebates allow a drug manufacturer to pay a rebate to a party in order to get some kind of preferential treatment  Usually related to the insurance companies formulary    The drug manufacturer will increase the billed price of the drug and use part of that increased price to pay a rebate to the insurance company    GoodRX captures that rebate and passes a large portion of that to the consumer  Most insurance plans pocket that difference  Some share it with the employer if the employer is wise to what is going on    If you are having this issue with a health plan that is sponsored by your employer  you need to bring this to their attention and ask them where are the rebates going    Health insurance falls under ERISA law  If your company is mismanaging this  you can sue them    Former employees of Wells Fargo and Johnson   Johnson are suing said companies for this exact thing  Google it    Happy to answer and questions you might have on the topic,0.0

2024-12-08,I do understand that for SOME self employed PEOPLE  premiums shot WAY UP with ACA   Thry should have done some kind of phase in for people in your situation   Important to know  you were probably always one diagnosis away from your premiums skyrocketing    You never happened to have anything come up  which is great   but you could have at any time  and then you would have had a  pre existing condition  and either had premiums skyrocket or not be able to get insurance at all   Now  with ACA  people who have ongoing conditions have the option to be self employed    And people with a child with an ongoing condition  they have the option to be self employed  instead of only people with no family members with ongoing conditions  Again  I do understand it was  at least temporarily  better for a subset of people before ACA  and you happened to be in that subset   I have believed  since the beginning  thst they should have done something to offset the increase for people in your specific situation and phased out the offset over time bor something like that     I get it   But it s better  in general  now  for sooooooo many people    Which doesn t mean it couldn t be better than it is now  but what we had before wasn t better  in general  even though it happened to be better for you  that far in your life,-1.0

2024-12-08,In terms of moving forward  here are a ton of ideas    I would look at all the ambulance companies in your area and identify if any are in network  Then if your daughter does need a transfer  at least you know what can be done  And be really really honest with your care providers about the financial implications of an ambulance  just as you had been previously  doctors understand and can help you think of alternatives that would work  I wouldn t lie or refuse to give information  first of all  you ll want them to have her medical chart and history which is under her name available in order to properly treat her    Second  see if you can call a nurse triage emergency line at the ER before bringing her in to determine if she really needs to go in immediately or if you could drive her the    min to the pediatric ER  It sounds like you had done this previously and were advised to stay home and monitor  while that is stressful  if it s saving you a ton of money that can be put towards your kids future  it might be worth the trade off  See if there are medical devices you can buy to more critically monitor her at home  like a pulse ox or a blood pressure reader  That might make you more comfortable with a long drive or a  wait and see   You can always be on route to the children s hospital and then call an ambulance if she gets worse in the car    Another idea  you said she was a teen   is she an older teen  I don t know how specialized your pediatric floor is  but sometimes they can make exceptions and admit older teens to regular floors if their issue is not too complicated    Appeal with your insurance company until you re out of appeals  for each individual case  If one case is overturned  ie  they decide to pay   have them go back and look at your prior cases  Document every phone call with dates  names of reps  etc  Submit complaints to the insurance office in every way you can  Be so annoying    Once you ve exhausted that process  you can try the ambulance company  If both bills are from the same provider  you may be able to negotiate to pay     up front and have the rest forgiven  Google this before you do it  because you ll want the deal documented properly  Alternatively  made medical providers offer    interest payment plans  While you re still paying a lot  ultimately    interest is a huge win    Some of these suggestions may be helpful  some may not  Hopefully you get some medical answers regarding your daughter s condition which will help you avoid these emergency scenarios,-1.0

2024-12-08,It s not cut and dry  Yes it is true that if you are under a certain income  you may qualify for free or extremely low cost healthcare  whereas once you reach above that the price can balloon  But the quality of care and access is not the same  so it s not an apples to apples comparison  and there are going to be other healthcare disparities when you are living at such a low income that can still put you at higher risk for many serious healthcare issues    I m a nurse and I ve done a lot of travel and per diem work around the country in different hospitals  there is definitely a class system when it comes to Medicare because the doctors and hospitals are paid less in most cases and the paperwork is more extreme so you end up having these high end hospitals that won t take Medicaid patients and then these dirty dilapidated places that will  Obviously  I m over generalizing a very complicated situation  but that is the big picture   Even when they expanded Medicaid and my son was considered eligible under the expansion  I opted out of it and chose to pay the premium for him to stay on my PPO so that I could choose his doctors and clinics and hospitals  etc  instead of being forced to go with the ones that accept his Medicaid plan  It may have saved me some dollars months to month to go with Medicaid  but receiving inadequate care or poor care can be expensive in the long run as well so I don t like to be pennywise and pound foolish    Also keeping in mind other factors that affect your health  if you are very low income  you are more likely to be living in an area with poor air quality such as near a lot of factories  and having less access to clean and safe outdoor spaces  etc   etc  all of these things that have been shown to affect overall health so you are likely to be sicker on the basis of being poor itself and so your healthcare needs may end up being much higher and you are paying that way even if the medical care you receive out of pocket cost less   So as a middle class person who has been on the struggle bus before  even though it costs me a lot on paper to maintain my lifestyle  I still know that it is more expensive to be poor and would not choose poverty with  free  services over my current life  even though it s a hustle,0.0

2024-12-08,I think you are confusing different options   Your mother would be receiving  in patient  OP and PT at a skilled nursing facility   That is different than receiving it on an out patient basis   therapist can come to the home but for better results you would go to a facility    If it is a good SNF the PT and OT will be very good and will occur every day    There is no set number of days except that     is the maximum that Medicare will pay for   What will occur is there will be periodic reviews to confirm that the patient is benefitting from the daily OT and PT and making progress and so it is medically necessary to remain in the facility for rehabilitation   As posted  there will possibly come a time when the patient will be discharged because they no longer need skilled nursing and they aren t really benefitting from daily therapy sessions as theoretically they can do home exercises between visits by the PT or visits to a PT center on an out patient basis   I faced this with my father  He was being discharged and he lived alone albeit in a retirement type of place  However he would not be safe being left on his own even in that situation since he could easily have fallen  At that point I needed to hire a      home care attendant for his safety  If my mother were alive she could have handled it because he was mobile but it just wasn t safe for him to be alone as he could have fallen getting up to urinate in the middle of the night,0.0

2024-12-09,Great  thank you for this  I have already applied and been approved for the Cascade Silver plan  I would prefer to keep the Gold plan because that s what I had before my divorce for about   years  and It allows me only a     copay for my medication  I am tied to Regence  my therapist and psychiatrist both don t except Molina  Also I am in Whatcom County  there s pretty much just PeaceHealth medical services up here like the hospital and a lot of PCP s    The thing that I am most confused about is if my current Cascade Gold plan automatically renews  will it be      month or something else  You say that I should amend my application  but the email specifically says that I don t have to do anything for it to renew  Can I cancel my application for the Silver Plan  The only indication that it would cost more was in the application  but if my current plan renews then am I  applying  for that plan again or does everything just roll over to the next year  Idk  I am not very well versed in health insurance terminology  My advance tax credit for the past year was      and it did go down to      so that explains some of the price hike but not all of it,0.0

2024-12-09,Ahh ok so in this case the holdup could be either with the provider or with the insurance  My guess is it s probably with the insurance  because based on what you ve said the provider is pretty diligent    I would check in with both however  Any time you or the provider contact the insurance  be sure to get   pieces of information before hanging up  the case   and or call reference number and the name of the rep you spoke to    The rep will likely only give you a first name and so it s not ultimately helpful  but I ve found that if you have any issues and say  I spoke with a rep  call reference number was XYZ  they stated XYZ  they still want to know the name of the rep you spoke with as if you have no credibility without a random first name    Having the call reference number in particular allows subsequent reps to look up the notes from prior calls and string together your call  the providers call  etc    I hope you get this knocked out soon  Be sure also that you re clear with the provider on what exactly your patient financial responsibility will be under the SCA,0.0

2024-12-09,The deductible is the amount you must pay out of pocket before your insurance begins paying for care   Per your summary of benefits  your deductible is        and your insurance pays      of emergency care once you ve hit the deductible   If this is the first time you went to the Dr in       you should expect to pay        for your ER visit with your insurance paying      of the bill over         If you ve had other healthcare in      you should expect to pay        minus any previous out of pocket expense incurred in        This doesn t mean your ER visit was not covered  The visit is  covered  in the sense that the amount you pay will apply towards your deductible and out of pocket max  When a visit is  not covered   it does not apply towards the deductible oop max and therefore does not get you closer to the point where insurance starts paying        Note that you should not pay the hospital bill until you ve received an EOB from your insurance company and verify that the  patient responsibility  on the EOB matches the amount due on the hospital bill  The EOB will also show if anything was  not covered  and thus not applied towards your deductible  If parts of your bill were not covered when you believe they should be  you can file an appeal with your insurance company   If a   k bill is unaffordable to you  consider purchasing a co pay or co insurance plan rather than a high deductible plan  Premiums for these plans are typically more expensive  but insurance will start picking up the bill sooner  For example  my co pay plan has a      copay for ER care before I ve hit my deductible  Compare that to your plan which charges you      of ER care until you ve hit the   k deductible  High deductible plans aren t bad per se  but you need to be able to afford the deductible if you choose a high deductible plan   If you are lower income  you may be able to get your bill reduced through the hospital s charity care financial assistance program,0.0

2024-12-09,The Affordable Care Act  ACA  is not directly related to your concerns  The cost of insurance is determined by hospitals and doctors  and individuals with six figure incomes are not eligible for financial assistance to reduce these costs  Additionally  insurance companies do not market the same plans in every state because the federal government does not dictate the plans available in each state  Premiums are only deductible if you have a group plan  which are generally more expensive than individual and family plans   Here are two options for you to consider      Research and compare insurance carriers in your area to find the one with the lowest rates      If you are healthy  consider finding a doctor and hospital plan that is not ACA compliant  Pre existing conditions are not covered for the first two years   It s important to note that the ACA is the only source of  affordable  healthcare because insurance companies can only market plans that cover all essential needs  While a six figure income without a household of five may not require financial assistance in purchasing insurance  this was never the primary focus of healthcare,0.0

2024-12-09,There s the EMTALA which means the guy in the car accident just going to be on the hook for the full amount because the insurance is not in network      The hospital has to stabilize a person before they can worry about money    Hospitals then wind up not being able to recover a lot of that  like the homeless people coming in for frostbite or overdoses that have no money or insurance      To cover those costs is partly how they justify having such high fees for the emergency room    It s not that it costs       to roll into the ER  it is that it costs      and the previous   people didn t pay   Then it gets to be what is medically necessary   https   content naic org sites default files consumer health insurance what is medical necessity pdf  So it becomes an argument between the doctor reccomending the treatment  who has a financial incentive to provide the treatment  and the doctors the insurance company employs that argue based on the treating doctor s information provided that the treatment is not necessary  appropriate for the diagnosis  or generally accepted    As long as those insurance company doctors can provide enough of a reason or evidence of generally accepted practice that it is not necessary  then it is denied     I don t know for sure how much of a burden of proof those standards have to be met   The insurance company doctors though do not have the patient in front of them  and have financial incentive to deny the claim or delay it long enough that the patient gives up one way or another    Making medical decisions  doctors have to be fairly egregiously negligent to incur criminal penalties     Maybe it does happen  I suppose I too would be curious to know if it has at all      I would imagine the panel that denies claims is going to only do so with enough evidence to be able to avoid that criminal penalty  those physicians themselves are not ignorant of the law and the guidelines  those are their primary concern   Who wrote those guidelines       People that were likely influenced by the insurance companies    Ergo  the likely hood or frequency of criminal complaints along these lines are going to be scant   It is in the broadness between those guidelines that people are dying    But there is no one advocating for them  because the policy holders and the voters don t have a voice in defining those guidelines,0.0

2024-12-09,Most likely the claim was denied by your insurance because they didn t receive the supporting documentation in time from the provider  When a claim is denied  there s no payment responsibility from either the insurance or you    It is possible that the provider is still working to get that claim reprocessed again and paid  That s probably why they are still holding to your money  even though they should have refunded you  If in the future this claim is re reprocessed again and re  allowed  your insurance most likely won t apply the allowed amount  to deductible since that deductible amount has been applied to a different claim by now,0.0

2024-12-10,You re going to have to pay      of the allowed costs up to the deductible if you take the HSA before you start paying copays    So that s       up front you ll have to pay that you don t with your current plan     But you save      a month in premium  so that s       you don t have to pay out up front      So yeah  the HSA probably makes the most sense   It has a lower OOP max and lower copays once you hit that deductible   And if you are using lots of services  then you SHOULD set up an HSA account so that you can deposit money for the deductible you know you ll spend   That way you can deduct that money on your taxes and pay with pre tax dollars,0.0

2024-12-10,I think you named the problem in your question   profitable  Â    If you look at national healthcare systems in other industrialized countries  you see that there are medical necessity rules just like here  plastic cosmetic stuff wouldn t be covered  generally   But the difference in those tax based government systems is that they don t need to be  profitable   They just have to be solvent  Just like free public education isn t profitable  And typically doctors there are paid salaries  whereas here they are typically paid per service procedure  which leads to a lot of inflated billing Â    I will also say that detractors of public healthcare often cite the UK because it s honestly the worst example  Very dysfunctional system  But that s biased  When you compare apples to apples  you can t just pick the most rotten one and then compare it to a fresh orange  The UK is like the Ambetter of health insurance  It sucks Â    If you want to look at  successful  models  look throughout the EU  They have slightly different approaches in different countries  France  Italy  Scandinavia  Spain  But the essence is the same  they spend a fraction of what we spend here in healthcare  so lots of savings   with far better health outcomes  They save by capping prescription prices  paying salaries  etc Â    Some of that saving is thanks to a widely and easily accessible model of primary care  something that Obamacare tried to institute here with the free annual preventive visit  But that s still incomparable  Imagine having free or very very cheap access to your primary care doctor  the one who knows you and your history  not some random urgent care doc  anytime you re sick  same day  not just once year  And you don t have to wait months to see your PCP  You can call them  they can come to your house  or you can just walk into their office and they ll see you that same day if it s a business day  IMO a huge chunk of system savings comes from this kind of prevention  If everyone can see their own doctor when they need to  you can prevent a lot of disease from worsening Â    Different countries are better or worse about ease of access to specialists and to imaging  But again  if we compare apples to apples  what kind of insurance plan in the US would you need to have to have easy  fast and direct access to specialists or imaging  Not to mention to centers of excellence  If we are going to compare  we have to compare the average experience in two places  not the Cadillac exceptions Â    So no  health insurance companies wouldn t be profitable if they approved every  valid  claim  not even talking about bogus claims   That s why there are a gazillion rules and restrictions and limited networks to prevent otherwise valid claims from being approved  You go to one place that the directory said was in network  but turns out the doctor you saw wasn t  and you end up with a bill  Or you talked about the wrong topic and suddenly your free visit isn t  Lots of hoops for the average person to jump through to get their  valid  claims covered  And since most people make mistakes or don t understand this insanely convoluted system  insurance companies stay profitable,0.0

2024-12-11,Yeah  I read Beckers fairly regularly  I just skimmed the articles you linked to  A large amount of those cutbacks are focused on administrative   non core hospital function roles  I think this is exactly how you  run better   There is so much administrative bloat in our healthcare and health insurance industries as a whole  So much room for improvement   I think a lot of the hospital s that are closing are struggling to secure patients  Especially so in rural America  That imo is a real problem that needs to be addressed but the methods in which you do that are the billion dollar question  Do you continue to allow them to overcharge for services  Why are patients not going there  Does a local population have enough of a population to support a hospital system  Are the good doctors not willing to live in rural America so the patients follow them into the larger cities to get the high dollar care they need   Another problem is the insane amount of vertical integration happening  The large hospital systems are buy doctors to capture referrals  A lot of doctors had to sell out during covid because they couldn t survive as an independent during covid  This issue has too steered people away from the smaller hospital systems driving the closures you refer to    Large hospital systems are not hurting  Hospitals are consolidating and focusing on vertical integration  I am personally knowledgable about what large hospital systems are willing to take for payment  They will take a non traditional insurance contract for      of medicare  some of these contracts come with no strings attached  others require a plan using that contract to reduce member out of pocket costs to drive volume  and walk about of the room smiling    If you find the large hospitals that are required to publish their balance sheets  you will see they are not struggling at all  Some of them have billions in assets  When you dig into that you will find a common theme  They love to purchase  land for future use  and just sit on it as an investment  They then do not have to pay property taxes on that land because they are a non profit hospital system  This raises property taxes for the general public,0.0

2024-12-11,TL DR it depends on what insurance you have      One of my adult kids was in a bad car wreck in the spring while still on our health insurance plan  they can stay on until age        We have a health savings account  so my husband puts the max in pre tax dollars in the account which is taken out of his paycheck before his earnings are taxed    Our deductible  which we have to pay out of pocket  for the family is I think around        This is pretty good and you can use the health savings account money to pay for it   Which you still pay obviously plus you have to pay for the health plan itself monthly out of your paycheck     So this kid ended up with broken spinal and hip bones  I m going to be a little vague since we are still dealing with the fallout  and was taken from the crash scene to a local ER for evaluation then transported by ambulance to a regional trauma hospital and was there for a week on the trauma floor  no surgery or ICU needed   Then they were transferred by ambulance to our local hospital  crash was out of town  where they were on the rehab floor for a few weeks  So       weeks or so in hospitals    They also needed a speciality back brace        and outpatient PT   times a week for several months    So we paid       out of the health savings account to be reimbursed for the money we had to pay until we reached that amount and the the rest was paid by our insurance company at        So we never paid a dime for the back brace for instance    This kid s medical bills were in excess of    k  One EOB  explanation of benefits  was     k    So all in all  we were about to absorb the       and that was all we had to pay    I have no idea how much we pay per month for the insurance plan as I think the company pays for most of it    Hope this helps,0.0

2024-12-11,Well a couple things    if you live in the USA health insurance is not solely tied to employment   I have been without a employer on and off for decades now and am currently retired and under the age of      I get health insurance direct from insurance companies and or the ACA state exchanges   It costs the same as an employer sponsored plan although usually higher deductibles  and I have gotten the same care and coverage as the employer plans I have had     As far as EU is concerned  I ve live and worked there as well as my partner   Salaries for similar jobs are usually   but in some cases not always  much lower AND the taxes ARE higher    In the US a lower average wage earner will sit in the    or     federal brackets   pay       in social taxes  capped at           total    and depending on state       and depending on city  most of them are          depending on income    Even the worst state  you d have to be pounding     K in income or more to get hit at even close to      but your social taxes are capped still at      K max    Take a country like France    You wages for similar job  even tech  are usually     what you can make in the US   You usually don t work OT however   First every pays        of their income to the social tax   NO CAP like in USA   Subtract that tax from your income and then apply the remainder for federal taxes and your tax rate for the average citizen is either the    or     bracket  So clearly your average citizen is at or near and maybe even over       Then there are local taxes as well and most employed people also carry private insurances on top of that thru their employer to cover things not covered by state medical coverage AND to speed up your place in line for treatment    My partner turned down a job that would have paid half what she made in the US and after having a team of US and EU tax people prepare likely tax outcomes  should that she would take home a whopping     of her salary and bonus   And since she is a US citizen   pays into the pension plan but doesn t get any claim   just a credit for time worked against US system   Bottom line    for a higher income person  say         EU    you end up paying     more in social taxes or         vs US where you can get a decent policy for               depending on age     vs     and your social taxes are capped at          for a total of                 AND the US would probably be     K to     K for same job while social tax and health care premium stays the same  If you get seriously hurt your OOP max can range from       to       a year      So for a lower income person   the EU socialized medicine model is AWESOME   if you get seriously hurt  And how often in your life do you get seriously hurt      I do wish people would run numbers and or live in other countries before making wild claims,0.0

2024-12-12,So  when you have   insurance coverages  there are set rules for which is primary and which is secondary  because you have coverage through your job AND your parents    your job s insurance is primary and there is no getting around that  You can t just put your parent s insurance and skip over your insurance  If you ve done this with other care you ve gotten  you may want to try and untangle it    because insurance always figures this out and  it may end up costing you a pretty penny    If you put your parent s insurance down  but not your work plan    even if insurance did approve it  if they figure out later that they were not the rightful primary insurance  they can retro deny the claims  I ve seen this happen   years after the fact  Because it s too late to then submit a claim on time to the rightful primary insurance  your work   then you end up with the bill in your hands  no inurance helping to pay it    Most insurance companies give between        days to submit a claim on time  I ve seen   policy in my years that give    months   After that time is up  it s automatically denied for not being a timely claim  If the provider couldn t submit the claim to the rightful primary because you did not give your primary insurance information to the provider  then you re stuck with the bill    I am assuming this might be what s going on here   and if you have other providers you ve failed to give the right insurance information to recently  I d try to fix those before it s too late,0.0

2024-12-12,Hi  if you go to a large hospital system  UCHealth  or Boulder Community Health  you can asked to be screened for fin assistance such as Medicaid  CICP and the Hospital discount care   Each of these are based on a income threshold  Each program has different income limits  Also  you cannot be denied medical treatment if you go to a ER  if its really bad  due to not being able to pay at the time of service  Â Once seen you can ask for someone to screen you  I know this to be true because I did this job at Boulder before I retired this year  Always ask the facility for help with bills  They would rather take a reduced rate and do payments than not be paid at all and go through the hassle of collections,0.0

2024-12-12,Think about what you said in regards to car insurance    You pay for it    You hopefully never need it   But when you do need it  you NEEED it     And if  god forbid  you should suddenly have a life altering injury  or be diagnosed with cancer  and have massive hospital bills  because that would      wipe out your financial life if you don t have any health insurance    And if  god forbid  that happens to you  the costs your insurance will be paying are FAR more than any premiums you paid yourself     now you re being supported by premiums paid by other people  healthier people    The whole idea of health insurance is to spread the risk around across large numbers of people  so that when some  one  gets hit with huge costs  the safety net helps them     If you want     payback for your premiums  then just put that money into a savings account for your future healthcare needs    Maybe you ll get lucky  if you re willing to take that chance     But maybe the first treatment bills will wipe out those savings and now you re on your own      As you said     I m super healthy and never need to go to the doctor for anything             YET,0.0

2024-12-12,Best advice  Get out of CVS  Just stop using them    In the first     years I used CVS for my meds  CVS never required more than one PA per year for the two meds I filled there  one of which was a GI medication   the other a seizure medication   But then during the last two years I used CVS  that horrible pharmacy gradually began to require PAs EACH   EVERY MONTH for BOTH of these meds  simply because these meds were more expensive than the other meds that were then available to treat my GI   seizure conditions   they wanted to push me out of using these meds  all together  Instead  to stave that off  I opted to use the generic forms of these drugs as soon as those generics became available    And that worked for a while    But then in the last     months of my time as CVS customer  they began again requiring that I get a PA EVERY MONTH for these meds  EVEN AFTER I had already agreed to switch to taking the FAR MORE AFFORDABLE generic forms of those meds  at CVS s explicit request  in order to make their constant PA BS go away    Oh    they started playing this game even though I had been with the EXACT SAME prescription drug insurance company    nothing else about my coverage  my provider prescriber or my health diagnoses had changed    But their full endgame became clear to me when I was finally pulled aside one day   told the full story about what this crap is really all about  This soothsayer was a pharmacist friend of mine  I d run into her at Target  who d left the employ of CVS   had since become the GM of a small  mom   pop  independent pharmacy  She told me that sometime in early       CVS Corporate began pressuring its pharmacists to put ALL CUSTOMERS who are on long term maintenance meds  of any cost profile  regardless of their health insurance drug coverage  etc  on their mail order service  which unequivocally SUCKS   I was warned about this  lest I mistakenly   unknowingly agree to try to use that service   get burned by it     to put any   all customers who refused to be put on their shitty mail order service into this never ending  circular torment of CONSTANT PA requests  just to stave off for as long as possible the monthly stick orders CVs would have to place for its customers  monthly maintenance meds    I took the leap  followed my pharmacist friend to her local  independent  mom   pop  pharmacy   have NEVER looked back  I get ONE annual PA request  if that  from this new pharmacy  instead of being accosted by CVS s bogus  circular  nonsensical   MONTHLY PA requests    wherever possible  my new pharmacy calls   talks to both my prescribing provider   my drug coverage company to negotiate for long term PA agreements  in an attempt to save me money at the start of each new calendar year  when I m in that    day period where I may also be dealing with out of pocket costs for my other medical expenditures  before I meet my deductible for the new year    So just dump CVS  but don t jump into a similar situation by going to another  big box  retail pharmacy  instead  try to find a small  independent pharmacy mom   pop  pharmacy to patronize  where the pharmacists   techs take great pride in getting to know you   will offer you an entirely new world of service options just for the pleasure of doing business with you  no more corporate retail pharmacy BS from CVS  You ll be doing yourself a HUGE favor    Good luck  Feel free to message me or respond here if you need more help  And I hope you enjoy good health into the new year  too  friend,0.0

2024-12-13,Its also worth noting       While I KNOW unnecessary treatments and tests for money DOES happen  its weird to me that this  campaign  hasn t defined waste or abuse on their website  which could make their research skewed to their favor   What determines whether or not a DIAGNOSTIC test is unnecessary  Like I GET that having a brain MRI because your leg hurts is unnecessary  But having an MRI for migraines is not unnecessary    The thing is with diagnosing patients  if you cannot find the problem and it is still affecting quality of life  most doctors want to keep looking for the cause so that they can improve quality of life  I even get that some ailments can be asymptomatic  and have no underlying cause  however  where does anyone  or this foundation  draw the line in it being labelled as waste or unnecessary  And if ONE patient sees a positive outcome from the diagnostic  what right does anyone have to say that the test is unnecessary and wasteful for someone else just because that same outcome is unlikely  Especially if they have already tried all the common solutions to the health concern at hand   I have heard countless stories of people dying of some type of cancer because them getting it is unlikely due to their young age  but they did have it and insurance denies them testing for it  I get that you should test for the most likely outcomes first  But unlikely things DO happen in medicine  and diagnosing someone is always going to be inherently wasteful if you have multiple things to test for that it could be and it ends up being a rare occurrence that someone didn t think could happen  But does that mean they shouldn t be tested for it,-1.0

2024-12-13,It depends  I have seen situations where the difference between the estimate and the actual bill is because there was a discrepancy between the codes included in the estimate and the codes billed on the actual claim  I have seen scenarios where the doctor ends up billing for an additional code  I have also seen situations where people ask for an estimate of a service with a specific doctor but then the health plan s is also billed for associated labwork or anesthesia  If that s is the case then you may not have much recourse because your insurance company can only give you an estimate for the services they are told about  But if the information you were given was just wrong there may be options   There are some protections under state and federal law  I believe that the No Surprises Act has some cost transparency protections  You can call their hotline                to see if this would apply  Some states also have laws related to cost transparency  You should be able to contact your state s division bureau of insurance for more information  It s also very concerning that you never heard back after your appeal  In most cases there are strict regulations about appeals and response time  You may be able to file a complaint about that as well with your state,0.0

2024-12-13,I work at a men s health clinic in LA and we see mostly gay bi men  I was surprised when I read OPs post because we code almost all of our patients as high risk  Based on what OP said  he d be coded as high risk as well  I m not on the billing side of things  but my understanding is that because CDC guidance on HIV and STI testing recommends more frequent testing for men who have sex with men  coding the patient as homosexual makes it more likely to be treated as preventative rather than diagnostic,0.0

2024-12-13,Ah OK I wasn t clear from what you wrote on this post  In that case you might consider it  but only if you re the kind of person who won t mind having uncomfortable conversations with providers  Typically with an HDHP you pay nothing up front  then the provider submits to insurance  then you get an EOB  and finally you get the bill  At that point  you could ask the provider for a payment plan  or I ve heard of something called  care credit  that seems to be the same thing either way  zero interest  Or just delay paying the bill for a while   Some providers are starting to try to charge up front  but you might still be able to negotiate a payment plan at the time of service   I would add up what care you expect to have over the year and try to estimate the cost  then add it to the premiums  Keep in mind that even before deductible  you pay the negotiated rate  which in my experience has always been less than      for doctors visits  routine blood tests  and X rays   MRI  ultrasound etc are more  but less than        Also factor in any free preventive visits care   Do the same thing for the other plan  Don t forget to count the co pays they can add up    Also  if you have an FSA plan available  consider electing that so you can pay with pre tax dollars  ironically  with a non HDHP plan the full year s amount becomes available on day     If you don t  or don t want to contribute because you re uncertain about your future expenses  consider factoring into your annual total that the HDHP lets you pay for care with pre tax money even if you pay out of pocket early in the year  you can wait until the end of the year and use your entire HSA balance to pay yourself back  If your marginal tax rate is      and you have       of expenses  that s more like        If the difference is large  then you could consider trying to make the HDHP work this year and hope you can negotiate around your cash flow concerns  If it s small  then I would say just try to save up this year so you can feel comfortable doing the HDHP next year,0.0
2024-12-13,I don t think that s going to work    If hypothetically you could switch plans  and that s a big if  but I m not familiar with MA Healthcare so maybe it s possible   If you could switch plans they would reprocess the claim when you switch plans to fall under your new benefits and it would be subject to deductible  They are not going to just eat the cost of an MRI and then let you switched to lower premiums  That s absolutely something they can do  insurance reprocesses paid claims all the time    But most likely once you re enrolled you cannot switch plans to prevent exactly this scenario,0.0

2024-12-13,Your provider billed the       as a new patient office visit  This is standard practice when you re seeing a new provider regardless of why you are there  The preventive visit would be a separate visit  Your insurance should cover the new patient visit you might have a copay or coinsurance for it but that is standard but there may be some cost sharing  The issue is likely that they billed the diagnosis code in the first or second place with either cpt code       or        They need to modify the diagnosis code used and or move it to the third or fourth place for billing  They should list more common diagnosis codes like Z      Of note it sounds like you might have a high deductible health plan  so you basically have to pay up front for your care until the max out of pocket is met  It s possible that because of how they billed some lab tests with other diagnosis codes and the CT and GC tests with primary diagnosis of Z       while a relevant code is causing the test to be covered as diagnostic not preventive  If your providers office is not willing to change the billing find another provider  seek testing at planned parenthood or local public health department where there should be a cost share for you  You may also have a better experience  The doctor should never put you in a position where you do not feel like you have the option to say no,0.0

2024-12-14,I m wondering if your health insurer   the insurer that covers your medications   might have the wrong diagnosis on file for your thyroid condition   It sounds like they might     There is a difference in Dx in treating a diseased condition of hypothyroidism where the main objective is  to boost the levels and to treat a condition when the thyroid is missing or dead and can no longer function at all   then it is called Thyroid Replacement Therapy   The same drug is used to treat both   your doc should be able to clear this up with no problem by making sure that your diagnosis is correct in your medical file   The insurer is only trying to perform their utilization management as required   well  at least they are required to do it under Medicare      I know you probably are asking yourself why is this any business of an insurer   because it is their responsibility to perform such utilization reviews to make sure that something detrimental is not happening to you   They have tons of reviews that are all fed into a system that isn t meant to be individualized   it is only looking for problems but it is only as good as the information fed into the system     So technically your doc would be correct that you have hypothyroidism BUT the underlying condition is known   that is your thyroid gland is dead and you have to live with thyroid replacement therapy for as long as you live    The difference in these two things is where your problem lies   The doc  the insurance company  you and your medical files need to all be on the same page,0.0

2024-12-15,I think your example is an illustration of how statistics can be misleading   A high deductible plan for someone like yourself is not going to negatively impact outcome because you have sufficient income to easily afford the out of pocket costs   Also there are a lot of expenses that someone with cancer has which aren t reimbursable by insurance anyway and so higher income people are better able to afford these things  Palatable food  help with care  perhaps more stable relationships which means better support all impact outcome    Also   unfortunately   high deductible plans really aren t suitable for a lot of people who get them because the premiums are lower and they really aren t equipped to handle high out of pocket expenses including seeking diagnostic tests early on   Also there is probably a correlation between survival rates just based on socioeconomic factors in general   better nutrition   better living conditions   less financial stress,-1.0

2024-12-15,I was thinking Medicaid plans like Medicaid CHIP FFS  It is mainly a payment structure   what all things were before HMOs Â    All plans can technically have OON coverage with a prior auth  For example  EPO plan can cover an OON if there is no other provider INN that can address the issue   like an OP treatment rehab or infusion center  However  it has to be approved first   an exception to the rule  Would not recommend planning on that as a member Â    HMOs predominately are health management  Referrals and PCP requirements are the traditional methods of management but if the covered population is young or healthy those may not be necessary and plans can be more flexible  Maybe more chronic disease programs instead of referrals  Have also seen HRA plans that mimic a flexible HMO,0.0

2024-12-15,You re definitely not overthinking it  Some BCBSTX plans apply the copay to the deductible and or out of pocket and some don t  The SBC SHOULD match the EOC  but if it doesn t the EOC is more likely to be correct    GENERALLY if it says you have a copay though  then you shouldn t have to meet the deductible for the services where the copay applies  and your SBC matches that  It s also what I m used to seeing with HMO plans  The biggest exception to that I can think of at the moment is an HSA plan  which federal law prevents insurance on paying on prior to the deductible being met  but it doesn t look like you have one of those    However  I would call BCBSTX again and try to escalate the call if they can t give you a clear answer  If that still doesn t help  report it to the Department of Insurance  They have to be able to clearly answer questions like that  I m sure the SBC is accurate and safe to trust for this question  but to me this shouldn t be as much of a matter of how much you trust the documents and more so a matter of them being to answer the questions they re required to be able to answer,0.0
2024-12-15,Having only an oral estimate makes it very difficult to prove what happened  let alone why and whether it violated any legal obligations  Your insurance company owes you a response to your appeal  but since they aren t saying it s not covered  right   that s not likely to work unless they just did the math wrong  like they said you haven t met a deductible and you have  or they applied the wrong level of co insurance   You may want to contact the provider  explain you were given bad info by your insurance company  and try to negotiate a lower amount and or payment plan  What they re charging sounds high compared to what I ve seen charged for CT scans  I got a coronary calcium scan  which I think is a type of CT scan  which is not covered by insurance  And it cost       It sounds like yours was more complex if you had to drink something first  but still they might be happy to get half what they re asking for   You could try to escalate this to your employer  if the plan is self funded by your employer  or to the state s insurance regulator otherwise  I m not sure how to complain about ACA plans  u cblennie provided some helpful info at this post    https   www reddit com r HealthInsurance comments  b xr m what _rights _do _i _have _when _my _insurer   https   www reddit com r HealthInsurance comments  b xr m what_rights_do_i_have_when_my_insurer,0.0

2024-12-15,I ve worked in health insurance for quite a few years now  and honestly the clinics and insurance carriers are almost always at odds and both will tell you it s the other one s fault  They re both right  and it s more complicated than either one wants to admit    There are different ways an insurance carrier can decide which network a clinic will be in  Traditionally each clinic had its own contract with the carrier  and payment rates can vary quite a bit from one facility to another  A big clinic chain with lots of locations and different specialists is obviously going to have more pull and larger payments than a small clinic with limited access and fewer services  Theres also a premium for clinics with more prestige and name recognition  the Mayo will get bigger payments than Smalltown Family Clinic    There has more recently bern a push from carriers to try different pricing models  like payments based on health outcomes and efficiency  I ve worked with plans that based payment on health outcomes and effective treatment  From the carrier s POV  if the big fancy clinic is running way more tests and scheduling twice as many procedures  but their patients aren t any healthier than Smalltown Clinic  they re doing something wrong and the carrier might not want to partner with them    You can also have plans where the copay varies from one facility and doctor to another  This way the consumer can decide whether it s worth a bit more to go to a big name clinic  or if they d rather pay a little more to have a primary right in their hometown instead of having to drive further for a big clinic    There s also some bundling that goes on during contract negotiations  Medicare and Medicaid payment rates are set by the government and could be lower  so some facilities don t like taking those plans  Carriers might tell them that in order to be in network on all their commercial plans the clinic has to agree to take their Medicaid medicare members too    So in short  there is no short or easy answer  Like any other business there has to be financial incentive or no one would do it,-1.0
2024-12-15,This isn t accurate   Straight Medicare with a Supplemental Policy covers all expenses  It is probably the best insurance anyone will ever have because there are no networks and generally everything is approved easily    Advantage Plans are different because they are run for profit by insurance cimoamies    You might be confusing hospital stays with nursing homes as these are only fully paid by Medicare for     days following each separate hospital stay of more than three nights       The issue of someone needing to live in a nursing home  forever  is a completely separate issue in terms of funding and generally Medicaid pays after a person has depleted their assets if they haven t protected them through some form of  of estate planning,0.0

2024-12-15,I think under old medical plans  there was sometimes a limit on what insurance would pay out  per condition or total  I don t think that s allowed currently   Perhaps the people you hear about with big hospital bills are uninsured or had that type of plan   Also  insurance may not agree about whether care is medically necessary  or it may not cover care on the grounds that it is experimental  That leaves patients with a tough decision   A small example is the coronary calcium score test  In my group of friends  pretty much everyone has had the test  but insurance doesn t cover it  I think the theory is that everyone should be eating right  exercising and taking statins if cholesterol is at all elevated  so understanding your cardiovascular risk isn t actually necessary  Fortunately it s a cheap test  but it illustrates how insurance companies apply the language in their contracts,0.0

2024-12-15,I agree      that everyone should have access to HSAs  even if they don t have health insurance  If everyone was paying cash for healthcare  cost of services would drop dramatically  Why   Let me explain     Healthcare providers artificially inflate what they bill because they have to bill out the same amount for each code regardless of the payor source  If they don t bill a high enough rate  they won t collect the full amount that each insurance will pay  So they bill a very high amount to ensure they receive the max reimbursement     Insurance then processes the bill down to their allowables  Then the patient has to pay their deductible before the insurance will cover anything  The way the billing is done  it makes it look like insurance is helping significantly by providing discounts even if they really haven t paid much  The reality is that the cash price is often less than the discounted insurance rate  I ve seen the cash rate be     of what is actually billed to insurance  Meaning the patient is not only paying insurance premiums  they are also paying for the majority of the healthcare they receive  There are a few cases where insurance actually is a financial benefit   but in the majority of instances  people would be better off without it entirely   I say this as someone who works in healthcare     If people were paying cash  they would actually look up the cash rate before going to see the Dr and would likely  in some cases  look for a cheaper provider  In other cases  you just want the best  but at least you would know how much it was going to cost you first     The problem is that most people are not fiscally responsible enough to put aside the money every month when they are young and healthy and don t think they will ever need it  Also  there are too many entities that financially benefit from the current system   so I don t see it changing anytime soon,0.0

2024-12-15,What does the EOB state regarding provider network status        If the provider is in network and they were reimbursed their full allowable fee  the provider is committing a contract violation by not accepting the allowable amount  Overbilling  also known as balance billing  is not allowed by an in network provider    If the provider is out of network  they can bill you the difference between their standard fee and the amount paid by the insurer  If this is the case  you can appeal the amount paid to the provider and request additional payment based on Fair Health values for your zip code and services   On the provider side  I m seeing more practices attempting to add  fees  to claims that are not part of their insurance contract  These fees are often considered part of the other billed services and denied  However  I have seen some practices attempt to collect on these denied amounts,0.0

2024-12-16,Nope    First Google Fair hearing trial and then the name of your state  Look into what that might entail    Next  call the insurance company up on a recorded line if you are a one party consent state  and let them know that instead of doing an appeal  you are interested in a fair hearing trial    That means the insurance company would have to present data on their end proving why it wasn t an emergency  And then you and your doctor would have to present data on your end showing that it was an emergency  and I would combine both the letter the nurse wrote and also the prudent layperson justification   And usually when you drop those words  the insurance company will about face  And you re going to want that recorded  if it s legally to do so in your state    Insurance companies absolutely do not want to deal with external appeals or fair hearing trials  because both are conducted by independent panels of experts  And usually  they do not rule in favor of the insurance companies because the insurance companies act unruly a lot of the time    And external appeals are generally only for non ERISA plans  but fair hearing trials can be done for all types of health insurance plans I believe  double check on that,0.0

2024-12-16,Does your doctor accept  any  insurance or have they switched over to cash only    The first thing I d do is ask the drs office what insurance they re in network with  If any of those overlap with any of the plans you have access to  I d also ask if there are any other names or spelling that you might be able to find in the provider directory  Then double check the providers list    You  might  be able to get an exception  but only if you can show that this doctor has a necessary expertise that you need that no in network doctors can fulfill  They won t do it for continuity of care if there are in network doctors that can handle the issue  even if not as well     Your other insurance option is to choose a PPO plan that has out of network coverage  But  with out of network coverage  there is usually a separate deductible you ll have to meet before they start paying and the doctor can balance bill you if the insurance doesn t fully pay  So  depending on the insurance and how high the bills are with this doctor  that may or may not be helpful    And  finally  you can cash pay  as long as you aren t on Medicaid   Most doctors are perfectly happy to see self pay patients and have cash rates upon request,0.0

2024-12-16,Hello  Is there just you in the household  If your medicaid eligibility is pending then it usually makes you wait till an approval or denial before enrolling in a marketplace plan  Not sure what you re exact income will be  but there is a special enrollment period for low income individuals who do not qualify for medicaid  The income range is between        and         So if you re denied for medicaid  and your income is between those two specific figures  then you can enroll with an effective date of the first  It s very specific numbers and kindof hard to get  Not sure how long a Medicaid denial approval will take in MO  but if you are approved  sometimes it will cover you retroactively up to three months  which is good  If you re denied  try to get your income between those two special enrollment period numbers  If it s definitely not between those numbers  you should be able to enroll with low to   dollar premiums with tax credits factored in  but you should try to do that before the end of OE    I know that s a lot of information  Hopefully it makes sense,0.0

2024-12-16,OP  I ve spent    years working in health insurance   including direct work with state insurance departments   Those departments may only be able to intervene if you are enrolled in a  fully insured  health plan  If you have a  self insured  plan  though  the insurance department may have no legal way to get involved with your claim denial   The distinction in this is who pays the    for claims  the insurer or the employer   Ask the company offering the plan  your employer   to you whether it s a fully insured or self insured plan   If you have an individual market product instead  where you buy insurance directly from the insurer   and not through an employer   you will likely be on a FI plan   If you have a FI plan  ask the employer group offering the plan   or UHC    for a copy of the Evidence of Coverage   EOC   for your health plan  Either of these parties must give you a copy of this legal document  Your EOC explains your health plan   including any rules for obtaining care from network providers  Some EOCs explain clearly  or least reference  when and how you may get care at a network hospital   The document should tell you if services at a network hospital may  oddly  be out of the network   This can happen with such care as lab services or providers such as anesthesiologists  who at times may not be contracted with the hospital  but yet participate in surgeries at the network hospital   Some EOCs explain these out of network facilities or providers within a network hospital as  facility charges  or  non facility charges    If UHC doesn t provide this specific information to you while denying such services on their plans  you can point this out in your appeal   If you have a FI health plan  often you are permitted under state law to make an expedited appeal after your health insurer denies your initial appeal of the claim   Expedited appeals must be reviewed and decided upon within a specific number of days after you file it   Even if the expedited appeal is denied by UHC  you may still have the right to have a state arbitrator make a final decision on whether or not UHC must pay the claim   Your state health insurance department can help you with this process and answer questions you may have about the process   Also  your EOC will explain the process and timeline   Also  if UHC communicated to you by phone  email  or letter that your services at the hospital are covered in network  you can argue that you  relied  on that information in your decision to receive care at that hospital   and birthing  center   Reliance is a strong legal argument   and UHC knows this   In full disclosure  I am not an attorney   However  I have worked in a health insurer s legal department for    years   I have helped a few family members get their health insurance claims covered based upon reliance  You may want to seek legal advice from an attorney who specializes in health insurance law   OP  I hope you are successful in getting UHC to pay for your birthing center services   I also hope that my comments here make sense,0.0
2024-12-16,If the provider was in network  it s their responsibility to get the PA  not yours  The grey area here is that the lab was OON  But that shouldn t have happened  Your doctor should have sent the order to an in network lab Â    Once you get a hold of the EOB  call your old insurance to ask them about it  This is definitely worth appealing  You can still file an appeal with the old insurance Â    By chance  was your doctor part of an outpatient hospital facility  I ask because in that case the federal No Surprise Act would offer you some protection from the OON lab  to be clear  it wouldn t protect you from the lack of PA  only from the fact that the lab is billing you OON rates   But that lab protection only applies if your doctor was part of a hospital outpatient facility  rather than an independent clinic Â    Next time don t give in to pressure sales tactics whether it s a medical biller or a used car salesman,0.0

2024-12-16,Woof ok I did not realize anyone yelled at you  I m sorry they did that   I agree with you  And I m guilty of it  My current bedside job is in emergency pediatrics  and it s very difficult  as a nurse  to not be frustrated with patients sometimes Â   Some parents have   control of their children and allow them to completely tear apart the exam room  I m not talking about developmental disabilities  just kids that have no consequences for anything they do  And who has to clean and restock that entire room  Me Â   Other times it s the kids themselves  have you ever been thrown into a wall by a    year old trying to elope from a hospital room because they don t want to go to jail for bringing a gun to school  I don t recommend it  and I was also very frustrated with that child for a few minutes while I collected the stars that were spinning around my head Â   But I would never come here and complain  I don t even talk about this stuff regularly  except maybe to my mom  because it s depressing  because I feel pretty powerless to change these situations for people Â   Anyways  I agree with you  People need to hold the folks at the top accountable instead of fighting amongst themselves   And I do think engineers save lives BTW  It s a different thing than doing CPR on a baby who has been denied vaccinations by their parents  but we need it just as much Â   I appreciate you and your thoughtful replies  And I m sorry some doctors are total assholes,-1.0

2024-12-16,My understanding is that it takes a special enrollment period to change insurance  This was true when I had employer insurance and it s true with the Marketplace   If that s the problem  people dropping after getting major work  then a waiting period is even less logical  As others have said  insurance is not what they re selling  You can t insure a car after an accident and back date coverage  There are plenty of ways to avoid the problem without making someone wait in pain for dental work  Other industries have created solutions to that problem  It seems like insurance companies just don t want to bother finding a way to  insure  the need for catastrophic dental care    For example  why not look at the person s medical history  If they ve had checkups twice a year  problems would have been identified and documented  I m not certain if pre existing condition laws cover dental  I doubt it  but I admit I m not certain  My point is  these companies are not going broke because people need root canals  Dentists need to make a profit and patients need healthy teeth  What I now realize is that dental insurance makes both of those things more difficult  I m glad I found out so I don t waste money on the middle man,0.0

2024-12-17,Either you are confused about what  covered  means in regards to medical insurance  are you receiving EOBs and is what you pay being applied against your deductible or are you receiving actual denial letters   or you have a non compliant plan that is terrible    If you wanted extra cancer insurance  the time to sign up for that was  before  you got that whole body MRI  Pre existing exclusions will always apply to any non compliant plans  including cancer insurance  But  any regular ACA compliant plan is going to cover cancer treatment  although there are surely options a separate cancer plan would cover that a regular medical insurance plan won t  like experimental drugs treatments that may be excluded on regular compliant plans    You will almost always have to meet a deductible with any insurance plan  and that can be anywhere from      to several thousand dollars depending on the plan  and your liability via copays and coinsurance will extend up to your out of pocket max before you hit      coverage for anything more than a few basics like an annual checkup    Your best option is to go to healthcare gov and sign up for a plan with a decent insurance company  filter the plans by   stars and above to help with that  then pick a plan that has a combo of premium  network  deductible  and OOP Max you can work with  But get it done today since open enrollment is just about over,0.0

2024-12-17,Yes  most outpatient care  another word for clinics like PCPs  specialists  anyone who s not ER or a hospital admission  happens away from hospitals  but sometimes it s at the hospital  or just nearby in a different building on the campus  There s nothing wrong with a hospital outpatient clinic  except that it s sometimes more expensive   As for getting services the clinics can t provide  you go to the specialist s clinic  They re more likely to be in or near a hospital but they can also be whereever,0.0

2024-12-17,Usually  they won t send anything in writing if you don t need pre auth  unless you try to submit for pre authorization for those codes  Then the preauth dept will generate a letter Â   Where I ve worked  we ve flat out not believed them sometimes when they say no auth needed and submitted anyway   so that s an option  You just need doctors   facility info like tax id and NPI,0.0
2024-12-17,I work in ER billing on the provider billing side  I don t think this would be denied with her symptoms  If it does deny  the billing offices for the ER facility and ER provider will most likely appeal the claims with medical records  The diagnosis codes don t always paint the full picture but medical records do usually fill in those gaps  I do at least   or   medical necessity appeals for ER visits each week and most denials are overturned successfully when the records are sent in  I d sit tight for now and watch your EOB s closely so you can stay on top of it if anything does deny  It sounds like you used both the urgent care and ER appropriately  I hope your wife is feeling better,0.0
